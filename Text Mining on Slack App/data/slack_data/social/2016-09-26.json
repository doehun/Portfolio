We are planning to arrive there at 10am on Saturday October 8th, weather permitting. It is 45 minutes away from the IAA, in Youngsville. Anyone is welcome to come, with family or without, but it is definitely geared towards 0-10 year olds. There is a hay ride, mazes, animals, farm equipment etc for $14... 1 free pumpkin for every ticket bought. For $22 there are train rides and gem mining and other things. Generally -lots- of kid-stuff to do. \n\n<http:\/\/www.hillridgefarms.com\/harvest.php>\n(worst website ever)\n\nLet me know if you are going so we can all meet up! :jack_o_lantern:",
