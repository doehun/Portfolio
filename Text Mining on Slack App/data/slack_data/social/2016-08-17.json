You can't get the discount using their online system, but you can call in advance and buy your ticket over the phone or just show up and purchase your ticket (as of now, she said nobody has purchased any tickets for tomorrow night, so I think we should be good just doing that).  They close at 8, so I was thinking we could meet at 6:45 so we have time to sign the waivers and can have the full hour to jump.  Hope to see a lot of you there!",
