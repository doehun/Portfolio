I was thinking of going to Defy Gravity in Raleigh (<http:\/\/www.defygravity.us\/raleigh\/Pricing>) as opposed to Sky Zone because they're less strict on the rules. It's $14 a ticket for a 1 hour jump and it goes down if we have a larger group.   Like this if you're interested in going this Thursday around 7pm!",
