It's about 2 miles with 4 workout stations that include stretching, push-ups, pull-ups, some core work and some plyometrics. The point is to challenge yourself with some cross training and shows different levels for fitness abilities throughout.  So we will be meeting at our usual meeting spot at the institute on Thursday at 6:30 am.  Looking forward to it!  ",
