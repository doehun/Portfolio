Why are we creating and storing data, how do we do it, what is the point? I can get the right answer, but I am not completely comfortable describing how I got the right answer. \n\nIf you fall into one of these categories then I would like to invite you to a Lunch and Learn  tomorrow in Onslow from 12-1PM. I am going to break down objects in Python in a way that makes it really easy to understand the overarching concepts. Whether you are a seasoned programmer or this is the first time you have ever seen code in action, I invite you to stop by!",
