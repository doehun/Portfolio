Kimberly G., Sharon W. and I are helping to coordinate things and we thought it would be fun to turn it into a competition BLUE vs. ORANGE cohorts. We're going to place a box in each classroom for you to put items in.  One item= one point.  The cohort with the most points wins!  We need the supplies dropped off in the boxes no later than Thursday, July 28th. Winner gets bragging rights... LET THE GAMES BEGIN!:dancer:",
