Also, I'll be posting a message in the general forum that we have about 10-12 spaces available if your friends\/family\/other MSA folks want to go.  Thought I'd tell you folks first since you're already going to be there so you can have first crack at the tickets.  I'll be letting others know Thursday afternoon.  Looking forward to it!",
