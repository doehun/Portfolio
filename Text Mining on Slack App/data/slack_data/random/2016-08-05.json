The description is a bit vague but it has to do with the Olympics and virtual reality, which sounds cool. It's also low commitment (aka free), so I figure it can't hurt to check it out. If anyone is interested, let me know! <http:\/\/www.eventbrite.com\/e\/courtside-xperience-usa-opening-day-games-vr-sponsors-samsung-att-tickets-26807894133>",
