There are tons of rescues in the area in desperate need and you can bring a puppy, dog, kitten, cat (whatever works for your lifestyle) into your home and out of the shelter for a few weeks. Plus, you get puppy\/cat\/dog\/kitten snugs! Robin and I got our first foster cat yesterday from Meow House Cat rescue (who currently need about 20 more foster homes for the number of cats they have. They're way over capacity.) and most other rescues have the same need.  Most rescues cover all the costs associated with pet-ownership, so your main responsibility is socialization. And that's the fun part! We know we eventually want to get a cat, but with all the uncertainty of the job search and future living arrangements, fostering was the best idea for right now!",
