Speak up, politely calling attention to any potentially discriminatory or exclusive behavior\n2.    Not feel shame or guilt if someone calls me out for having an implicit bias\n3.    Keep an awareness of my privilege\n4.    Include female and gender-neutral pronouns in hypotheticals\n\nIf anyone feels like they're being blamed for things they didn't do, consider shifting your focus to what you can do.\n\nI\u2019ll admit that I have a long way to go. Women disproportionately assuming the note-taker role wasn\u2019t on my radar before Thursday. Subconsciously, it felt natural. I\u2019m thankful it was brought to my attention and I'll be mindful going forward.",
