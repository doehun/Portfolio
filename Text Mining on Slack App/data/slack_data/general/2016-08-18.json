I know everyone will pass it, but... the make-up date for  Bus. Analyst is Nov. 10th. Look on Moodle for practice questions. Business Analyst does not have as many readily available study materials as BASE because it is a fairly new certification (about 3 years old? maybe 4 now). You don't need to prep as hard for it as you do for BASE b\/c it's much more straight forward and is what you've been studying here since Primer.  Our students typically do very well with this exam. If you want more information, you should google the test. (The business analyst exam is A00-240)",
