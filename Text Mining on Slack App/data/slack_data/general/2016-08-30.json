I live within walking distance of Carter Finley stadium (around a 10 min walk), and there's ample parking at my apt building, so we can park there and walk over. If you plan on coming, respond to this post in some way so I can have an idea of how much food to get.\n\nWhen: After class on Thursday - around 4:30 or 5:00 PM! We will walk over to the stadium around 6:30 PM!\nWhere: 5401 Creek Ridge Lane, Raleigh NC 27607\nWho: Anyone! My apartment isn't huge but it's on the ground floor and opens to a little grassy area so I think there will be enough room\nWhat To Bring: BYOB, I'll have some food, but feel free to bring more.",

You're all welcome to use it so long as you clean it, and respect when I need to use it.  Since I'll be burning through a lot of beans and half and half too I ask that you all bring your own.  I'll be doing the maiden voyage with this press tomorrow morning as I try and get the coffee to water ratio right, so come early if you want to taste amazing coffee, lets get brewing!!",
