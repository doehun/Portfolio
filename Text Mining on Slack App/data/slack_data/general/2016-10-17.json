Update on the babe (besides being the best): GREAT suck reflex, he gobbled down his first bottle. He can be held - not skin to skin because of IVs. He is alert and has good muscle tone! He is pooping! (I never thought I'd be excited about that)! Clinically, for now he looks great. The concerning: the neurologist confirmed that he has HIE - mild to moderate brain trauma in his frontal cortex. The doctor says there is a risk for developmental issues but cannot put a number on what the probability is. Cerebral palsy ruled out for now. It's possible there are no developmental issues, and there is a potential that there is. Time will tell. Regardless of the potential issues, he is prefect and amazing and such a blessing to us already. My wife has been a total champ and is recovering well. We are still processing all of this but are grateful for the progress he has made. Thanks all for your love and support. I saw that many of you signed up for the meal train. Thank you so very much.",
