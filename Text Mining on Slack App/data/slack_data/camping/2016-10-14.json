This will make things simpler logistically in case someone gets lost along the way. \n\nGeneral Packing List: Backpack, Snacks for the hike + breakfast Saturday, Water bottles (we will be at a higher elevation which will cause you to consume twice your average amount of water), Layers of clothing of all sorts, Extra shoes, External batteries for your phones, Flashlights.\n\nWeather Update: At Mt. Mitchell, the weather over the last 3 days has been a high of 55 around mid-day and a low of 44 at night. Make sure you have what you need in order to be comfortable. \n\nPayment: See James or David if you have not paid yet. \n\nHere\u2019s our numbers if you need anything!\nJames <tel:(928)699-3668|(928) 699-3668>\nDavid <tel:(704)222-9512|(704) 222-9512>",
