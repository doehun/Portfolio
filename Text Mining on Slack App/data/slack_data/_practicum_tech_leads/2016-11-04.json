Be sure to close the command prompt when you're done using it to free up resources.  Inform your team that even though it runs in a web browser, the server is actually on the practicum server (address 127.0.0.1 points to your practicum server in case you wondered), therefore data is never leaving the practicum server and policies are not being violated",
