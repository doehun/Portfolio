I asked the guy at the desk where studio D is and he said second floor. First staircase took me to bball courts, then i went back down and took another staircase to the running track. I asked another gorl working there wth is studio D and she said it's in a separate building. By the time I got to the rec center my class was half way done. I got pissed and went home and ate ice cream. I feel like such a disaster. <http:\/\/i.imgur.com\/HN151LX.gif>",
