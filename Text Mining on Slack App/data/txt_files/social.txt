Just throwing it out there, if anyone needs a place to watch the Game of Thrones season finale on Sunday night, hit me up! I have known the struggle of not having HBOGo!
hey all, some of us are going to see Finding Dory at 6:45 tonight at Regal Crossroads 20 theater because they do discounted tickets on Tuesdays ($6.50).  The address for the theater is 501 Caitboo Ave, Cary, NC 27518.  Hope to see some of you there!
^If you can't make it, we're thinking of going to CineBistro maybe next week to see another film :slightly_smiling_face:
CineBistro rules!
Is anyone at regal crossroads yet? So many kids! 
<@U1KRB11QC>: coming?
We've got an extra ticket
(Claimed by David!)
It's sold out, in case anyone else was going to try and make it
Madison Tommy and I are going to get margaritas at On the Border over near Cary Town Center tonight if anyone else would like to join!
Tonight is also Brews n' Board Games night at World of Beer in Cary if anyone is interested. Event starts at 7. More details: <http://meetu.ps/e/BJWsH/w0HSh/a>
<@U1KT5F4SZ>: Excellent idea! I would love to join. What time are you meeting up tonight?
<@U1KRLV1CG> Happy Hour prices end at 7 so we were thinking to get there around 5:45 to take full advantage of that.  Margs are $3 today and there are a ton of other deals.
Excellent! Thank you for your response and see you then! :slightly_smiling_face:
Hello everyone... 

A group of us are planning on going to First Friday this Friday. This is the description from the site: First Friday is a free self-guided tour of downtown’s cutting edge cultural hot spots. Local art galleries, art studios, alternative art venues, and museums stay open late the first Friday of every month to welcome thousands of art-seeking enthusiasts downtown. 

Let me know if you're interested in coming! Link below
Hello yourself
<http://www.godowntownraleigh.com/first-friday-raleigh/about>
My building has a thing in their courtyard with beer/wine/food and music for first Friday so I'll probably be there for a bit all are welcome to come 
I'd be up for First Friday!
I'll probably be heading downtown at 7:30 on Friday. Hope to see y'all there! This might not be the best idea but I was thinking about bringing my bike to get around downtown?
Tommy and I are going to Chipotle after class if anyone wants to join because they're starting a new rewards program today. Also free chips and guac... need I say more? 
You had me at chipotle 
You had me at Tommy 
any Chipotle E. coli outbreaks in the Raleigh/NC area? :smile:
<@U1KRMNVGC>: meeting us there?
And which parking deck are you in?
Are there two more seats? I've got Ed with me?
Yea. We can fit. Alliance deck 3rd level near exit
We guessed wrong. Could you pick us up by the venture deck?
Yea. Well find it
It's right down varsity. One block from alliance 
What's everyone doing tonight? A few of us were thinking of getting together at the beer garden around 10! Or does anyone else have other suggestions? 
I up for whatever 
I'm heading to First Friday around 7. First at Deco Raleigh, then cruising down Fayetteville street. Let's try to rendezvous!  <@U1L3PU7BJ> <@U1L2P17DZ> <@U1KSEJ01W> 
Also, they are doing an outdoor showing of The Sandlot for free if that entices anyone 
Cool yea I plan on heading over there! Where are we meeting/parking?
Definitely, I'm gonna hang around at my buildings thing for a bit but keep me posted 
Cool, probably start at Deco Raleigh (they have a bunch of street art), then see who has the free wine! Not sure about parking though
I don't know what time I'll be over there, actually... I'll message you all and find out where your at when I come by
<@U1L2P17DZ>: do you know about when you would be heading over? I was thinking of going and we live near each other so we could ride together if that's easier 
Planning on heading downtown around 10. Up for the beer garden or first festivities on fayetville street. Let me know what people end up doing!
Me and <@U1L97TR38> will be heading to the beer garden around 10 as well
<@U1L5GU954>: <@U1L3PU7BJ> do you guys know where to park? I'm trying to figure out where's the best place to go...
<@U1L2P17DZ>: I've had good luck on the side streets. Bloodworth usually has space. Might have something to do with the name... 
<@U1L1WFNC8>: well that's not a bad way to start off the night
Not bad at all Matty! 
Anyone want to meet up and uber to downtown later?
We're planning on ubering from centennial later if you'd like to join
Going to the beer garden 
<@U1L5GU954>: where are you now? We're headed down to first Friday's now. 
<@U1KRB11QC>: sounds great. What time are y'all meeting?

<@U1KRMNVGC>: leaving 9:45-10ish come over whenever
Good deal. I gotta go eat dinner then grab gas and I'll head that way 
<@U1L5GU954>:  Hannah and I are walking to Deco Raleigh. Where are you all?
I live at Centennial Greens and will head to the Beer Garden around 10. I volunteer to be a DD. I can pick up people around the centennial area. Small car. I can fit 2 more people, or 3 if you are shorter than <@U1MPXSHN1> :slightly_smiling_face: Hit me up if interested
<@U1KRB11QC>: <@U1KRZT11T> when y'all say centennial do y'all mean campus or centennial greens?

I have a pool!!!!  
So, pool today or tomorrow then?
The Eno River Music Festival is today and Monday in Durham: <http://www.enoriver.org/festival/info.html>. I'll be there today from about 1:30 til close. Music + Beer + Cliff Jumping. I think it's $23 at the date for a one-day pass.
London Bridge Pub for the Germany match if anyone is around the area!
<@U1L95JP1S>: You cheer for Germany too?? :grin:  I'm watching it from North Raleigh, but let's set something up to watch the final next weekend!
<@U1L95JP1S> Forza Italia
<@U1KQ9523D>: KelkenBERG GO GERMANY! <@U1KSEJ01W> will be crying soon.
:see_no_evil: 
Should have checked the slack before the game to meet up!
Is anyone going out tonight? 
I'm studying at Jubala off Hillsborough if anyone wants to join
If anyone wants to find a pool and have some day-time cervezas, let me know 
Anyone interested in getting dinner in Raleigh tonight at 815?  I was thinking MoJoe's burger joint looked good but am open to suggestions.
<@U1L974M70>: I'd go!!
Ya me too. I could also do chipotle. Or maybe an Indian or Thai food place if anyone is feeling adventurous 
I'd be down for dinner too!!
I'm in for Indian or Thai at some point for sure
Mojoe's is amazing.  Can't make it, but highly recommend 
Ooo I may come !
I'm in for Mojoe's! Anyone want a ride from around centennial? 
Speaking of dinner, anyone without 4th plans up for eating dt tomorrow and watching the fireworks on Fayetteville St? Looks like The Pit takes group reservations--or any suggestions?
Let's do MoJoe's tonight, I'd be in for Thai/Indian another night for sure (Pit tomorrow sounds good also).  I'm leaving from Hunt library and can pick-up anyone as well.
Sounds good to me. And ya the pit is a great idea for tomorrow 
We tried The Pit last night and it is amazing! 
It's official! 6 PM at The Pit tomorrow and fireworks start at 9. Reservation is for 16 so we have plenty of space for anyone who wants to come along. 
If someone wants to give me a ride there  I wouldn't refuse! 
I'd love to go! And I can give you a ride, <@U1L46HXCJ> 
So mojoes at 8-8:15?
Yes! I'll be there at 8:15 
I'm running like 5 mins late but lmk where everyone is sitting! 
We have a table on the patio!
Struggling to find parking 
Sweet save me a spot im on the way!
Where did u find parking??
I am down for fire works tomorrow.
I'm also down for The Pit &amp; fireworks tomorrow! If I could grab a ride with someone that would be wonderful.
The pit is great! I'd be down for fireworks tomorrow too!
I'd be keen for dinner and fireworks tomorrow too!
 Yayyyy! I'll send out a message for a final headcount tomorrow morning to make sure we're all set! :flag-us::sparkler:
I'm down for fireworks too!
If anyone is out, me and <@U1KSEJ01W> are at The Architect right now 
Let me know what time you guys go to the pit! My trains getting in at 9 and the station is right by the pit so maybe I'll meet you guys and <@U1M4QJD4P> maybe you won't have to come get me after all! 
Like this if you're planning to eat dinner at The Pit at 6 tonight 
If I'm on anyone's way to downtown, could I grab a ride tonight? I'm on Avent Ferry near the intersection with Gorman.
I've got you <@U1KRBJP47>!
Just bought tickets to go see *West Ham United* v the Carolina Railhawks on *July 12* at WakeMed in Cary (about 10-15 minutes from campus) <@U1KRNHQA1> is going also. If anyone is interested there are still lots of tickets available <https://www.etix.com/ticket/p/6702817/carolina-railhawks-vswest-ham-united-cary-wakemed-soccer-park-carolina-railhawks>  Not sure who exactly from West Ham will play given that Payet is still killin' it for France in the euros but it should be a good time!
Whoever gets to The Pit first, the reservations are under Clare and Emmy! 
We're seated in the back of the restaurant come find us!
<@U1L914KNJ>: I am going to the game, as well!
Where'd yall park?
We parallel parked on the street!
Its crazy parking right now... Barely found a spot 2 blocks away 
I've added the LunchTrain Bot to help manage all of the outings going on. If you want to post an outing you type "/lunchtrain" followed by the place and time you're going . When it is posted people can click board the train to get reminders as the event/outing gets closer. If you board a train you no longer want to be on, you can click Get Off Train to stop notifications for that event. This will hopefully keep everyone in the loop.
fyi -- there's another bot that's already enabled called lunchbox (command /lunch) that'll allow you to get votes on multiple places. Slightly different purposes (certain about where you're going vs open to suggestions)
Anyone who wants to hit the gym after class during the week days let me know- I try to go most afternoons and would love a workout partner !
<@U1L8PJY4W>: I wanna hit up more classes! Leanne know if you're interested in any of the 5:15 or 5:30 ones! 
<@U1KR9BP0E>: <@U1KRNH021> and I are planning on body pump Thursday at 530!
I have been going to the yoga sessions, either at 5:15 or at 6:30, depending on the day. It is refreshing, yet calming after a packed day :slightly_smiling_face:
<@U1L0V1X61>: I've only been to a few classes and I'm very bad at it but I might join you- I want to try it regularly. Keep me in the loop next time you go! 
Let me know if you want to join me - there are usually a few spots open, even at the last minute
<@U1KR9BP0E>: I am going today at 5:15
<@U1L0V1X61>: unfortunately I can't do today. Next time though! Thanks 
<@U1KR9BP0E>: no problems :ok_hand:
*Lemme know. Ugh my typing is the worst!!! Sorry guys.
<@U1L0V1X61> I'm in for yoga today!
sounds good <@U1KQGK2CB> - see you there!
Dying to see The Secret Life of Pets this Friday when it comes out this Friday because I might not actually be 23 years old! There's a showing at 6 at Cinebistro in Cary where tickets are $15 and you can order food to your seat or a showing at 6:30 or 7:35 at Regal Crossroads where tickets are a little cheaper at $11. If anyone is interested (or your kids are), let me know and let's do it! 
(Ignore the redundancy of this Friday)
<@U1L8PJY4W>: if you haven't signed up for class yet you should sign up at <http://imleagues.com|imleagues.com>! You can also call the gym and sign up. There's around 10 spots left but they fill up fairly quickly.
<@U1KR9BP0E>: I'm on the waitlist but will show up either way!
doing cardio dance at 6.30 @ the gym today if anyone wants to join!
<@U1KQYG6SJ> <@U1L3G0YRJ> <@U1KT3UELS> signed up!
and more people should!
<@U1KQYG6SJ> did you set different entry messages? i just got one that said "remember, correlation does not imply causation". love it!
Remember that correlation does not imply causation!
haha... I did!
correlation is also a trigger word for that quote. Hence the slackbot response
Remember that correlation does not imply causation!
i don't understand the slackbot...
can i disable it? it's the worst!
haha
no, you can't :stuck_out_tongue:
I can remove the trigger though!
there are a couple set up
eg: hi!
Yo yo yo
I seem to have forgotten... slackbot, does correlation imply causation?
Remember that correlation does not imply causation!
haha
if you want me to remove that specific trigger, vote on this to let me know
Just got my student ID!!! #AnEternityLater <@U1KQYG6SJ> <@U1L3G0YRJ> <@U1KRWUXFU> 
does this mean you're coming to cardio dance??
<@U1KQYG6SJ> I sadly won't be there today, but am totally down for anytime next week! 
<@U1KT3UELS>: I'm glad someone else just got theirs! I'm going to get it during lunch tomorrow. 
We're catching The Secret Life of Pets at 7:35 tomorrow at Regal Crossroads! Probably getting dinner beforehand at Noodles and Co near there around 6:30! Come one, come all, bring friends or family-it should be adorable! (Also, might not be a bad idea to get tickets online just in case! It was a close call with Finding Dory selling out last time!) Text me at <tel:316-201-7500|316-201-7500> if you need a ride! 
<@U1L6WB44A>, Secret Life of Pets! Yeah!
Hello! I thought I'd shamelessly plug one of my favorite organizations in Durham. If anyone wants a study break on July 27th, the Durham Bulls is partnering with Book Harvest. Bring a new or gently used children's book to donate to Book Harvest and receive free admission to the game.

From the Facebook event:

Book Harvest is a Durham-based nonprofit organization with a simple mission: making sure every child in the Triangle and beyond is growing up in a home filled with books! Did you know that book ownership is the number one predictor of academic success for children? Sadly, 67% of American children growing up in poverty own no books at all. Help us change the literacy landscape by donating a book--and get in free for the game at the same time! Everybody wins (and we hope the Bulls win, too)!

If anyone wants to carpool, I'm driving

<https://www.facebook.com/events/133792157049622/>
Hello yourself
Some of us are going to go to wine authority in raleigh around 6 for a few end of week drinks! 
I'm going to watch the Euros final (France v Ronaldo) *Sunday 3pm* at the London Bridge Pub 110 E. Hargett Street if anyone wants to come. They also have an outdoor patio if you don't care about soccer but want to hang out!
<@U1M1L5G6L>: if you guys are still there around 7, I might join!
Anyone want to get a group together to grab dinner or go to downtown later? I'm up for suggestions 
<@U1KRMNVGC>: a couple of us talked about checking out the flying saucer later tonight. And then seeing where the night goes from there. 
Alright alright alright. What time?
Like 9:30/10ish
Conner and i are discussing a trip to the farmers market tomorrow. Anyone want to go?
Couldn't make it to wine authority but cheers to the weekend to everyone! 
<@U1KT5F4SZ>: are y'all at flying saucer yet?
<@U1KT5F4SZ>: <@U1KRMNVGC> still planning on going? 
Ya I just got here 
<@U1KRMNVGC>: be there in a few! 
Anyone want to go get dinner tonight? Maybe Thai or Indian like someone suggested last weekend?
Anyone know of a good place?
*checks yelp for good place 
These are some ones I've either tried or have been wanting to :
1. Kabob and Curry 2. Bida Manda 3. Garland 4. Indio 
Bida manda is so yummy! 
There's a place called Himalayan range Nepali restaurant that I would recommend. It's more towards Cary 
I haven't been to the other 3 but I heard garland is really good too. 
Garland looks really good
I'm in Wilmington otherwise I would love to join you guys! I'm slightly obsessed with Ethiopian food &amp; there's an Ethiopian restaurant called Abyssinia right next to Centennial.  Definitely worth a try. :blush:
<@U1KQ9523D>: I'd definitely love to try that if you want to go sometime later! 
<@U1L3G0YRJ>: I'm in! 
<@U1L7E8GSU>: yesssss :blush:
Garland,  kebab and curry are really good.
Should we try garland then? Meet there at 7 maybe?
I'm in for Garland! Should we carpool to try and minimize the problems of downtown parking?
Sure, I'm happy to take a group! Message me if you live near Avent Ferry!
Ya I'd be happy to drive a second car if enough people come. Where should we meet? 
Hope everyone is having a good weekend. For anyone that's interested Chance the Rapper is performing in Raleigh on October 7th. If you're not into rap music or don't know him all of his music is available for download online for free(he doesn't believe in record deals), so you can check him out. Anyways I know of one other person who is planning on going besides myself, and I hope others will join! You can get tickets here  <http://chanceraps.com/tour> There aren't a lot left but they're only $40. Let me know if anyone is interest or has questions!
I'm down for dinner!
I'm down for chance 
Did y'all check Garland's prices? They look a bit outlandish :money_with_wings:
I'm down to go somewhere else!
Kebab and curry has much better prices would y'all rather go there?
Yea I would go there
That works for me.
Me too!
Okay maybe we should text people we know are going that the restaurant changed just in case they don't see the slack?
Good idea! 
Let me know if you need me to contact anybody 
Meeting at7?
<@U1KRMNVGC>: we're here, in the back room! 
<@U1KRBFY3Z>: where is the best place to park?
<@U1KRB11QC>: come to the parking garage! 
Hey everyone I created a separate channel for people who are interested in going to the Chance concert in October. If you want to come or think you want to come join the channel so we can all figure out plans and get tickets together!
If anyone wants to get Mexican food with me at some point this week let me know! I've been craving it :stuck_out_tongue:
Yeah, i love Mexican food! Count me in. 

I have tried Gallo Pelon but am excited to try other restaurants in the area. 
Agreed. I'm in 
Centro!
on the border has $3 margaritas mon-thurs. all day if you guys decide to get mexican at some point
i really like gonza tacos y tequila off hillsborough, went there a few months ago
for on the border the $3 offer is the on the border location at crossroads which is super close to ncsu
Ooo okay does anyone have a preference of which night we should go? 
Thur? Fri? I could do tonight, but I still have a few quizzes to knock out. 
Let's do tomorrow ! <@U1M37FW5U> 
Thursdayyyyy :taco::taco::burrito:
Yay yay!!!!
:hot_pepper::hot_pepper::hot_pepper:
Ya Thursday is best for me too 
I'm in!
/giphy [taco]
Gonzas on Hillsborough is good for tacos. Dos taquitos on glenwood south is also really good. Avoid el Cerro at all costs 
Does either have free chips and salsa :eyes: 
Also Jose and sons near the warehouse district which is "southern Mexican" is a good one to check out 
Yasssss all 3 :raised_hands::skin-tone-2:
Dos taquitos brings them to you on a train too :thinking_face:
Jose and Sons is great, I second that! Great food and also great drinks
I'm too indecisive hehe someone else decide ! And if anyone wants to come who doesn't have a car lmk and I'll be happy to pick you up :-) 
Let's do Jose and Sons! Time? 
Just saw this, I'm in!
I'm in also. Happy to give rides if anyone needs it!
 630-7 maybe
Hey I just checked out the menu! A lot of the entrees are 15-19 dollars... :see_no_evil: is everyone okay with that or should we try and find a cheaper option ?
That's fine with me!
virgil's is downtown and it's like 4 dollars a taco and a cool space <https://www.facebook.com/virgilstacos/>
I'm down for Mexican!
so am i! can someone give me a ride?
For anyone who hasn't seen Moneyball (or those who want to see it again), I'm going to be showing it after class tomorrow (4-6ish) in Bodie. Let's pop some popcorn and get excited about analytics!
<@U1L5GU954>: Sweet! I'm in. :film_projector:
The popcorn will of course will have to be consumed in the kitchen/lunch area:sweat_smile:
Social events of interest:

First, is anyone interested in doing another (or first) escape room?  We get out at noon on Friday the 22nd.  Let me know via the Escape room channel or email.

Second, The Alley has $5 all-you-can-bowl bowling in Mondays. Anyone interested in heading over there after our assessments Monday to unwind?  It's over on Hillsborough street.
/giphy [bowling]
(I'd schedule the escape room for 2pm again on the 22nd in Durham) 
&lt;---- giphy novice
Bowling!!!!
I think we should all do Virgil's at seven! Does that sound good? Thanks for the tip Shelby!
Sounds good! 
I'm picking up tommy near centennial if anyone who lives near there needs a ride :)
I'm picking up sylvie from Cameron village if anyone needs a ride from here
<@U1L6YQUSU>: BOWLLLLLINGG YESSSS. 
<@U1L9DD1NY>: centennial campus or the centennial apartments?
Campus
I live on Gorman St (off Avent Ferry) if you can pick me up!
It's a 5 minute drive from the institute
<@U1L6YQUSU>: Bowling!! Yes! 
Yea sure !! <@U1KQYG6SJ>  can u txt me the exact address ?
Just did
Be there in ten <@U1KQGRG2F> !! Save us 3 spots :-) 
Moment of the night: the queso _doesn't_ come with chips?!
I would like to hereby give all credit for the bowling idea to <@U1KT5F4SZ> .  I merely typed her thoughts into slack. 
<@U1L6YQUSU>: I'm definitely down for bowling too! They also have really good, cheap burgers there. 
There will be a group heading to Goodberry's Frozen Custard on Tuesday during our extended lunch.  The flavor of the day will be raspberry.
I know we all have Stats to study but anyone interested in grabbing a few happy hour drinks tonight? I'm told Players Retreat is good spot but I'm open to suggestions. 
If u guys ever want to get cheap and good Mexican food, try chubbys. It's really close to here. Like 5 mins drive 
I'm going to Cat's Cradle in CH for a concert tonight.  <http://www.catscradle.com/calendar/> . Let me know if you're interested.  The group is Dorothy, check em out.
<@U1MBURU4D>: missed your message earlier but PR is a great place to grab a drink. Also $6 burger specials on Wednesday. 
The Hawaiian burger is incredible. On that note Hibernian has a $5 burger special on Mondays. I'm still looking for a $4 burger special...
Anyone down for dinner tonight? I've heard suggestions of Mexican or Thai food! 
only if said Mexican place doesn't charge for chips and guac/queso/salsa separately
:smile:
<@U1L6WB44A>: I'm in! Would be a nice study break!
<@U1L6WB44A>: me too! 
<@U1L6WB44A>: I'm down for Thai food. Definitely agree with <@U1L3G0YRJ> that it will be a much needed study break. 
Any restaurant recs for either category? I tend to accidentally pick the sketchiest places when I rely on Yelp :sweat_smile: 
Anywhere that is relatively cheap
Thaiphoon Bistro <http://www.thaiphoonbistro.com/thaiphoonbistro.com_menu.pdf> Thai House Raleigh <http://thaihouseraleigh.com/menu/#1462963735090-f966e100-af77> and Swasdee Raleigh Capital <http://www.sawasdeeraleighcapital.com/main-courses/> all look really good and have reasonable prices.
I won't be able to make it to dinner. But let me know if y'all do something after. 
<@U1L6WB44A> : I'd be down as well
Thaiphoon is decent. Haven't tried the other two 
Thai House sounds best to me, but it's pretty far away from where most of us live, same as Sawasdee! <@U1MBURU4D> , is thaiphoon decent closer to good or closer to meh? It's the closest it seems like, but we don't want meh! 
There's also Tom Yum Thai in Cary, Yum Yum Thai (lol) and Thai Sushi Cary that are similar travel distances!  They seem like pretty affordable strip mall restaurants. 
<@U1L6WB44A>: On that spectrum I'd say it's closer to good
Ok! How does everyone feel about Thaiphoon Bistro at 6:30?  If we can't get in there, it looks like there's several other restaurants nearby! 
works for me
Sounds like a plan
We are paying for parking! Be there soon! 
Are we still on for bowling tomorrow? The thought of it is all that's getting me through test prep...
I'd be up for some post-stats bowling <@U1L6WB44A> :8ball:
Me too!
Also just realized that emoji is not a bowling ball :flushed:
I figured people would just meander over to the Alley as they finished, since we'll all be wrapping up at different times.  Here's the website:  <http://www.bowlthealley.com/>
<@U1KT3UELS>: You could bowl with that if you wanted to, but it might not knock down many pins
:beer::beers::beer::beers::wine_glass::wine_glass::wine_glass:
Hmu if ur trying to get a marg or 5 
sooooo.. what time is bowling?
if we can agree on a time, that would be great
<@U1KS4UE2F>: a bunch of us are already here now! 
oh ok! 
if someone is planning to head there soon can give me a ride? thanks!
Hey I was serious above. A few of us Are going to el cerro around 7:30 :dancer::skin-tone-3::taco::burrito::beer::beers::tropical_drink: join us por favor amigos!
Good spanish <@U1L46HXCJ>!
This came up on fb. Just wanted to share in case anyone may be interested
<https://www.facebook.com/RogueNightlife/posts/733405273429104>
I'm still planning a Gooberry's run today if anyone is interested.  Probably about 12:40ish.  Raspberry is the flavor of the day.
Does anyone want two tickets for the Dierks Bentley concert this Friday? I bought a 4-pack and 2 of my friends can't go. Let me know!
Jazz lovers! (and everyone else) 
The BEST trumpet player of the triangle is performing with his quartet at C-Grace this Friday. If you don’t know C-Grace, you are definitely missing out! 
1)	One of the best cocktail bars in the area
2)	Live jazz music 5 times a week (consistently good)
3)	Gorgeous venue (1930s NYC cabaret ambiance)
Let’s get together at 7pm (music starts at 9pm), mix ‘n’ mingle, get a couple of cocktails in our system, listen to an hour or so of Jazz and then take the party somewhere else. I predict (using maximum likelihood) that this bar will eventually turn into the favorite spot for some people! I don’t know about you, but I feel that I still haven’t met a big chunk of our class! :disappointed: I hope this will change on Friday. No need to RSVP, come on out and say hi! I will be there at 7.

For all you foodies out there: <http://www.godowntownraleigh.com/restaurant-week/about> 
Let me know where you guys end up... We'll probably be at beer garden or around there tonight 
What are other fun places besides the beer garden that are reasonably priced/have standing room for lots of people? 
Not that I hate the beer garden. I'd be totally fine if we end up there too
Hey folks.  I'm trying to gauge interest in lining up a private Raleigh brewery tour for MSA students and their guests.  I need to get a count of who might be interested.  If you are, please react in some way to this post.  If you'd be bringing someone, react twice.  I'll put specifics on the group message board.  Let me know as soon as you can!  Thanks.
OK.  I updated the post in the forum, so ignore the first one.  I talked to the guy and clarified a few things.  Also, he reminded me that Sept 3 is Labor Day weekend, so we settled on August 27th.  Read through and let me know via email if you're interested so I can get a count.  <mailto:jrbetz@ncsu.edu|jrbetz@ncsu.edu>
Tommy, David, Zack, and I are going to Cook Out on Western ~7:15

<@U1KRZT11T>: Hope you enjoy your first cookout experience 
You always remember your first time
Marina, Sneha and I are headed to the beer garden. Be there around 8ish. :beers:

I was thinking of heading there around 9 as well 
Nice
Few of us up on second floor of the beer garden :-)
Tommy and I are heading there in a bit 
Anyone wants to go to the beach this weekend? April said it's probably the last chance we have this year!! We have only two people now.
Does anyone want to join me to see Goo Goo Dolls / Collective Soul on Saturday, August 27 at 7:00 PM at Red Hat? I'm a bit ashamed that Collective Soul is my favorite band and I've never seen them live... lawn tickets are $27
Which part are you ashamed of, <@U1KRE1L9M>?  The fact that they're your favorite band or that you haven't seen them live?  Or both?
<@U1KRZT11T> <@U1KRMNVGC> anyone want to go swimming at the quarry this afternoon??

Hello yourself
<@U1L6YQUSU>: Silly English... the latter only
<https://packapalooza.ncsu.edu>
Next Sunday :) 
hey all, does anyone want to try one of those trampoline places this week? maybe Defy Gravity or Sky Zone?
Anyone want to go shoot pool tonight :8ball:
<@U1KRWUXFU>: YES to defy gravity, so much fun!!
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IXzFOHrycHg>
<@U1KRE1L9M>: that was my same thought as well
I'm thinking of checking out C. Grace, which describes itself as a _cocktail lounge with a Prohibition-era feel presenting live jazz &amp; classic handcrafted drinks_. Anyone interested?
I used to live right near a Sky Zone in Boston. Big fan!
<@U1KQYG6SJ>, I'm pretty sure that's <@U1KRLV1CG>' favorite bar with jazz! 
<@U1L6WB44A>: Thank you for the pass! :slightly_smiling_face:
<@U1KQYG6SJ>: This is my favorite place indeed. I was there last night with some friends to a Latin Jazz act. They have Al Strong tonight who is leading an excellent quartet. I will join you if you go.
great! I'm thinking of arriving there around 9.30
Cool. See you then :slightly_smiling_face:
<@U1KRWUXFU>: there is a groupon for sky zone: <https://www.groupon.com/deals/sky-zone-raleigh>
<@U1KQYG6SJ>: I will check it out
<@U1KQYG6SJ>: how long are you planning to be there? I just read all of this and wanted to watch Phelps but then I would love to come for a bit! 
Don't know yet, but we just got here!
On Fayetteville if anyone else is out
Robin and I are thinking about doing one of the food tours for Downtown Raleigh Restaurant week! We were looking at the 5 pm tour on Wednesday that still has several spots open. They're a bit pricy ($65 per person), but it sounds like a lot of delicious food and fun and a good way to get to know downtown's offerings! If other people are interested in joining, you can read more and reserve a spot here: <https://my.getinsellout.com/providers/taste-carolina-gourmet-food-tours/skus/special-event-downtown-raleigh-restaurant-week-evening-tasting-tour/info?pl=-1#horizontalTab1>
Anyone up for bowling tomorrow afternoon? :bowling:
Free food?! :scream:
Going bowling later if anyone wants to join! Maybe 4:30ish 
Jk more like 6:30
You going to the alley?
<@U1L7E8GSU>: yeah! 
I live behind it so I'll stop by for a beer! 
Sammy's at 5, bowling at 6:30?
Yep
Robin and I will be at bowling!
I'll be at bowling a little late, around 6:45 so save me a spot please
The NFL season is only a few weeks away and with it returns one of America's great analytical pastimes - Fantasy football. Appropriately, a few of us are starting a league for the MSA program. If you are interested in having a team, message me by slack or email (<mailto:mjarmbru@ncsu.edu|mjarmbru@ncsu.edu>). Once I know who's in, I'll create a separate channel so we can work out the draft details. 
Lane 6! <@U1KT5F4SZ> <@U1KRWUXFU> <@U1L5GU954> 
Update: The league is full
Anyone want to grab lunch at noodles and company in Cameron village? 
Yea! Can I still join you?
Sorry Sharon I just saw this. I got it to-go instead 
I had no idea Cameron village was so close - pretty psyched to learn that!
Hey all, some of you expressed interest in going to a trampoline park this week.  I was thinking of going to Defy Gravity in Raleigh (<http://www.defygravity.us/raleigh/Pricing>) as opposed to Sky Zone because they're less strict on the rules. It's $14 a ticket for a 1 hour jump and it goes down if we have a larger group.   Like this if you're interested in going this Thursday around 7pm!
You picked a good night, Julia! The website says it's $4 off with a college id on Thursday nights! 
I need to get a final count of how many people would do the brewery tour on 8/27 to see if we have enough to make it go.

Please email me or message me if you're committing by 11:59 tonight. I need to give them a number by tomorrow.  

If you're not sure what I'm talking about, check the details in our Google groups message board or ask me.
This Saturday a couple of us are going to Mojito Night at Latin Quarters for salsa/bachata/merengue. The fun starts at 10:00pm. Let me know if anyone who's not in the latindance channel wants to join :slightly_smiling_face: :dancer:
Hey all, so I called Defy Gravity and confirmed that tomorrow is college night, so you get $4 off your ticket, which is actually a better discount than a group discount! You can't get the discount using their online system, but you can call in advance and buy your ticket over the phone or just show up and purchase your ticket (as of now, she said nobody has purchased any tickets for tomorrow night, so I think we should be good just doing that).  They close at 8, so I was thinking we could meet at 6:45 so we have time to sign the waivers and can have the full hour to jump.  Hope to see a lot of you there!
I won't be able to make it after all <@U1KRWUXFU> 
<@U1L3K1AKD>: no worries!
For those defying gravity tonight, if you fill out the waiver ahead of time, it could speed up the process! See you tonight! 
You can fill the waiver out electronically here: <https://defygravityral.pfestore.com/waiver/>
Does anyone going to DefyGravity need a ride or interested in carpooling?
The Brewery Tour is a go!  We have enough people initially (20) to schedule the tour and there's room for 10-12 more.  So if you find you're free or decide to come, please check the new "brewery_tour" channel for information or ask me.  We're going to have a blast and maybe we'll even blog about it.
I was told Ruckus Pizza, Pasta and Spirits in Cary (about 10 min from campus) does a good Trivia Night on Wednesdays if anyone is up to make a tradition (or at least try it out) next week! Plus, good specials! Or if anyone else has trivia night suggestions! 
I can't next week <@U1L6WB44A>, But it sounds interesting!!
<@U1L6WB44A>: I'm in!
Totally down for trivia night!
<@U1L6WB44A>: I love a good trivia night. I'd go depending on the time!
When the alumni were here, they said they used to go to Sammy's on Tuesday nights.  I was actually going to suggest that for this Tuesday, but hadn't gotten a chance yet.
Let's go to both and pick the one we like better 
Great idea <@U1KRNHQA1> 
Ruckus' starts at 8:30 on Wednesday and Sammy's is at 8 on Tuesdays! 
I love trivia! I am unavailable next week but count me in after that!
come join me over in channel sausageparty for a good time
This sounds so wrong
I'd be down for trivia at ruckus!!! Just let me know when!! 
Hi Everyone, my roommates and I are having a house warming party tonight at 7pm. Feel free to stop by if you're available. Address is 1220 Twin Branches Way, Apt 103. (It's right on Centennial campus). <tel:585-281-2425|585-281-2425>
Yo yo yo
Anyone interested for the packapalooza event tomorrow?
I'll be going for a period of time in the morning and will be back later that evening to see We the Kings perform 
<@U1L7B7188> when does it end? :slightly_smiling_face:
When people stop showing up... I imagine around 11, or so. 
2pm-10pm
Oops sorry my bad :( 
Who's going out tonight? 
 I am !
This guy
where are y'all going?
Where are you guys going? 
Undecided yet :flushed: any suggestions?
I'm in as long as we stray away from alchemy 
I'm up for something. As long as we also try to avoid most of the crazy undergrads. I'm not about watching freshmen get schwasted tonight 
Capital City was cool last time I was there
Architect was cool too.
Capital city will probably be packed with undergrads. 
How about trying Flash House? I heard good reviews about it.
I assume there's not many places to get away from em...first weekend back and all... :hankey:
I think there is an event tonight at Talley. 
Which do you think will have more undergrads? Fayetville st or glenwood..? Also I like architect too!
More undergrads traditionally at Feyetville
On the food tour I went on, they mentioned Greenlight, a speakeasy hidden in the architect that sounded really cool! You have to text a number to see if they have space and then enter through a bookcase in one of the Architect's hallways! 
<http://www.architectbar.com/the-green-light>
I been to Greenlight. It's not that great the way they are projecting. I liked the concept but didn't find it that interesting. 
If you are into dancing, Noir, Solace and Mirage (If you are brave) are excellent choices. These are all generally undergrad-free. Not recommended if you are not into dancing, as they can get pretty loud. I haven't been to these since I got injured, but they are the first ones I am going to hit once I recover.
A few of us are on fayetville now
do Raleigh clubs frown upon wearing chucks? :smile:
Fayetteville will probably have more undergrads, I feel like glenwood bars usually have a better scene at least on Friday nights !
We could do architect/London bridge/times and try to avoid both. But could end up on fayettville if itz lame
Some of us are at foundation if anyone wants to come!!
Where is everyone?
Julia and I are going to go try Gravy's restaurant week special tomorrow night and would love for people to join us! There is a $20 dinner and the special menu is listed here: <http://www.godowntownraleigh.com/restaurant-week/menu/13> If you would like to join us please like this message by 3 pm today because reservations are going fast!
If you're at packapalooza some of us are by the bell tower
Anyone going out tonight? 
We could get a group together to play Texas Holdem one of these weekends 
Hello all - I have added the_family_channel for those wanting to organize activities for the entire family e.g. hikes, strawberry picking, etc. Feel free to join! :slightly_smiling_face:
Yo yo yo
Voting Tuesday trivia this week, Wednesday trivia next week to compare? I don't know enough trivia for twice in a week :see_no_evil: See y'all at Sammys tomorrow! 
Anyone doing anything tonight?
I'm most likely going out <@U1KRZT11T> 
I'm not sure what I'm doing yet but anyone is welcome to come over beforehand ! 
I'm down to go out too
I'm up for going out. 
Is anyone else or downtown? Bunch of us are at architect 
Hey a lot of us are at big easy 
How much longer will y'all be there? 
We can't get into Capitol city :/
We're at capital city. Where are y'all
Where is everyone I'm trying to meet up with people!
Cap city 
Anyone want to grab an early breakfast from the flying biscuit?
<@U1KQYG6SJ> this still early enough?  I just woke up but im down

Be there in five!
See you soon!
(Sorry just saw this)
Are you there ?
Anyone going out tonight?
I was thinking about grabbing dinner at H street kitchen on hillsborough. Anyone interested?
Definitely interested <@U1KRMNVGC>. I've wanted to go since they opened a few weeks ago
Ahh I would have joined y'all but I just finished eating!
A bunch of us are going to boxcar right now if anyone wants to join. 
Anyone else want to join or are me and David looking at a date night? 
Wish I hadn't already eaten! Would love to know what you guys think of it! My list of restaurants I want to try keeps growing... 
Wish I were in town! That place is on my list - let me know how it is! 
Maybe we add this to the list for a future week
Haha sounds good 
<@U1L7E8GSU>: how long were you guys planning to go there ?
<@U1KSYP1M5> We just left :(
<@U1L7E8GSU>: aww okay next time! 
<@U1KSYP1M5>: for sure! 
A group us will be at the beer garden around 10 if anyone wants to come hang out
is there anyone near Gorman street who hasn't left for beer garden already?
<@U1KQYG6SJ>: I'm just leaving from campus if you need a ride
Where are you guys? We are at beer garden.
So are we. We're outside the first floor. 
Come to the back patio
Which floor?
Ooh
Just saw Rachel's msg
It's straight back on the first floor
You exit the building and walk toward the back courtyard
Calling those who enjoy documentaries, there is a free early screening of one produced by a Raleigh based director tonight at mission valley followed by Q&amp;A. Would anyone be interested? <https://www.eventbrite.com/e/thank-you-for-your-service-raleigh-nc-premiere-tickets-26162121610>
Hey--I can't make it tonight, but that does sound like a cool (real, necessary) film.
Hey Everyone!!! I didn't get a ticket for the football  game on Thursday, so if anyone knows of someone with an extra ticket I'll take you out for ice cream :icecream: :smile:
You should be working on the resume, <@U1KQGRG2F>  :joy: 
There’s a second request period today online <@U1KQGRG2F>!
THANK YOU!!!! <@U1LBRCSEA>
For all those going to the football game on Thursday, I'm having people over to my house beforehand! I live within walking distance of Carter Finley stadium (around a 10 min walk), and there's ample parking at my apt building, so we can park there and walk over. If you plan on coming, respond to this post in some way so I can have an idea of how much food to get.

When: After class on Thursday - around 4:30 or 5:00 PM! We will walk over to the stadium around 6:30 PM!
Where: 5401 Creek Ridge Lane, Raleigh NC 27607
Who: Anyone! My apartment isn't huge but it's on the ground floor and opens to a little grassy area so I think there will be enough room
What To Bring: BYOB, I'll have some food, but feel free to bring more.
<@U1KR9BP0E> I'll bring some beer
<@U1KR9BP0E> I'll have to think of something to bring besides David!
I created a football games channel where we can discuss getting together for football games!
<@U1L914KNJ> David &gt; Food. Just bring David.
Anybody want a ride over to Sneha's tomorrow for the game? I live in the same apartment complex so we can carpool to make parking more efficient! 
My practicum team is planning on going to the game and tailgating but are having a team meeting this afternoon, might have to meet y'all at the parking lot
For all those coming today, it's building 5401, Apt M (on the ground floor, on the left)! If you have trouble finding it call me: <tel:404-988-9650|404-988-9650>. The apt complex is called The Parke at Trinity. Any parking spot should be fair game but if you go just past 5401 there's usually plenty of spots on the left.
I can't join you all at Sneha's beforehand but I'll be at the game tonight. Look forward to seeing you all there!
Carl's on the Jumbotron 
Pic? 
Thanks to everyone for coming! I wish we got a big pic of all of us! Also whoever has the next gathering, I have way too many keystone lights courtesy of <@U1L415ECD>...
Haha, I can confirm 
Thanks for having us <@U1KR9BP0E> 
Party isn't over till the keystone are finished 
Anyone doing anything tonight? 
Netflix + sleeping
Anyone want to just hang out and watch a movie or play board games tonight?
<@U1KRZT11T>: Settlers of Catan?
Yea lets play!
What time you thinkin?

Cool, man! You got the board, too?
Yea and 5-6 player extension if we can get more people
Hard to tell if the six likes are all people who want to come, but it seems like the interest is there
Hah didn't see that I will message people 
Is anyone out?
<@U1KQGRG2F> and I are about to go out
I'll be out tomorrow night 
Where do I go to enjoy this pleasant weather?
If you have transportation, head to Duke Gardens.
Where do I walk/take the bus (near campus) to enjoy this pleasant weather? :joy:
Lake Raleigh is pretty nice or lake Johnson. Both close to or on campus and good for kayaking/paddle boarding
<@U1KQYG6SJ>: Lake Johnson is nice too. You can rent kayaks/canoes for 5$ an hour as well
Raulston Arboretrum is nice too
thank you all for your suggestions!
<@U1KQYG6SJ>: get a go pass frm ncsu for $5 
U can go to some of the places around campus then on the local bus system 
<@U1KQYG6SJ>: when I didn't have a car I was using a moped. It's fun on short distances ... (Im upset that there is no "moped emoji".... Something between :bike:  and :racing_motorcycle: )
I have a go pass <@U1KSBCBFG>
<@U1NUU2U9E> I cannot picture you on a moped
:smile:
Have u used that bus system before?i think it should take u some lakes and parks
There is lake Crabtree as well 
If u want to walk then go to pulled park 
Pullen*
On ncsu campus 
Has a lake and u can do the paddle boats
oh, when I said near campus, I meant I'm near campus, so I wanted suggestions for a place where I can catch a bus that runs near home (vs. say: a bus from downtown)
no preference for walking vs. buses
y'all are such big fans of water. probably should have added that I'm terrified of water :smile:
Ah gotcha. Then go to pullen park 
It's really nice (u don't have to go in the water) 
I'll try and check it out!
thanks!
Np :) there is a carousel there too if that gets u more motivated :p
:scream:
is it weird that carousels kind of scare me?
lol
I don't know why, it's not like they move fast or anything
Hahaha I shouldn't have said that then. I'm going to stop trying to sell the park to u then and tell u to go check it out :p

All, my family has a tradition of going to Hillridge Farms during Halloween season to get pumpkins and have some kid fun. We are planning to arrive there at 10am on Saturday October 8th, weather permitting. It is 45 minutes away from the IAA, in Youngsville. Anyone is welcome to come, with family or without, but it is definitely geared towards 0-10 year olds. There is a hay ride, mazes, animals, farm equipment etc for $14... 1 free pumpkin for every ticket bought. For $22 there are train rides and gem mining and other things. Generally -lots- of kid-stuff to do.

(worst website ever)

Let me know if you are going so we can all meet up! :jack_o_lantern:

Hi All. First, congrats on finishing Fall 1! As we roll into Fall 2, a few of us--who so dearly love the Halloween season--thought it might be good to put a couple fun events on the calendar as motivation. So in that spirit, <@U1KRBFY3Z>  and I (with many thanks to co-conspirators <@U1L415ECD>  and <@U1M1L5G6L> ) would like to announce HOWLAWEEKEND. Two parties. One weekend. A monster mash of good times. 

On Friday, Oct. 28th Sylvie will be hosting a party at 401 Oberlin Road (feat. Rooftop Deck, Jack O'Lantern Cooler, and Beer Pong). On Saturday, Oct 29th, my brother and I will be hosting a party at 5435 Silver Moon Lane (feat. Keg, Luke the Yellow Lab, and Fog Machine Dancing). Costumes are highly encouraged.

You might be asking yourself: Hold up, two parties back-to-back? Isn’t that crazy? Might that involve too much fun? Well the answers to those questions are, respectively, yep, yep and nope. That’s what HOWLAWEEKEND is all about, so get ready.

More details to follow.
Just throwing this out there:

I'm definitely interested in hockey and will also be rooting for the CAPS
