For anyone in need of business casual clothes, the LOFT is having a 50% off sale with free shipping right now  :slightly_smiling_face:
Ahh that's amazing thanks <@U1KRWUXFU> !
If you want another ~30% off at Loft, on top of the 50% sale, you can buy used gift cards here: <http://www.giftcardgranny.com|www.giftcardgranny.com>
Very not cool website name, but you can save a -lot- of money if you have big ticket purchases you are planning.
Physical cards can take a couple weeks to get, just fyi. But for buying computers, clothes, anything from big-box stores, you can usually get 10-30% off.  I have seen about a 5% fraud rate, but all of the gift card sites I have used for the last couple years have always refunded my money in those unfortunate cases.

Does anyone know where I can get something printed and bound for cheap-ish? The cheapest I could find was $20

I just happened upon this event in Durham on Meetup and am thinking of checking it out tomorrow. The description is a bit vague but it has to do with the Olympics and virtual reality, which sounds cool. It's also low commitment (aka free), so I figure it can't hurt to check it out. If anyone is interested, let me know! <http://www.eventbrite.com/e/courtside-xperience-usa-opening-day-games-vr-sponsors-samsung-att-tickets-26807894133>
Hey Zack, I can go--watching the Olympics in VR sounds interesting.  ALso, I live around the corner from there.
<@U1KRNTXL5>: Cool. I'll let you know if something comes up and I can no longer go, otherwise see you there!
Sounds good.

so umm... I just dropped my phone and cracked the screen pretty badly. Has anyone ever had their screen fixed at the Apple stores around here? was it a smooth experience?
<@U1KQYG6SJ> ouch good luck.  If they give you a hard time just chuck your phone at them. What do you have to lose?
hehe
I wouldn't go to the Apple Store. People can get certified to replace iPhone screens and they charge like $50. There were tons of people who had broken screens and went to someone certified at my undergrad. Unfortunately I don't know how to find these certified people... Maybe a Google search 
I got a recommendation for ubreakifix
so I'm going to check it out
Seems like a good time to change to a real phone - team Android ftw!
biggest worry is with the fingerprint sensors, if they don't get rewired the correct way, the phone stops working for apple pay
<@U1NUU2U9E> not in the market for a new phone... unless you want to pay
Yeah <@U1KQYG6SJ> a couple of my friends lost the fingerprint sensor when they went to someone outside the store... If you have a warranty I'd just take it to the store 
I don't unfortunately. However, sounds like the folks over at ubreakifix are pretty well-recommended and I can return if there are any issues
I replaced my cousin's ipad screen. Happy to fix you up too. I think the parts are pretty cheep.
hmmm
to be honest, I've done a screen replacement before
but I don't want to wait for parts lol. I'm already cutting my fingers on the screen
thanks for the offer though
<@U1KQYG6SJ> a friend of mine got his screen replaced at TCR on Edwards Mill Road.
And said that you might even find a Groupon for it
thanks Raj!
<@U1KQYG6SJ>: I used to replace them in undergrad for extra cash. It's not hard. 
I would get the people to buy their screen on Amazon or at a store and then I'd replace it once they got the screen. Only issue I've run into is screen quality. The replacement are usually cheaper material and they will crack in the future easier. If you're careful it doesn't make much of a difference. 
Just read the part where you don't want to wait for parts. Should have been more thorough while reading. Lol I would take the recommendations about local places then. 
^this.

<@U1L974M70>: love your contributions to the random channel- is this your most used/impactful channel? Does <@U1KS4UE2F> have the data to test this hypothesis??
<@U1KSPCE87> <@U1L974M70>  data up to August 25th shows that Rose is the most random person, and Bryan has 4 random posts. However, if I get more recent data, Bryan may surface to the top
Now I'm racking up counts in the random channel! :joy:
I'm going to try to catch up to Tommy
Ah! Didn't know about hoops! Maybe it's just a recent burst of randomness- Brian is trending up but rose is clearly dominating random

<@U1KT5F4SZ>: I like the way you think. Let's see how many they'll deliver to the IAA...
Looking again, the pizza thing is at 6pm. So no luck with the SLC, but pizza for dinner doesn't sound bad
That's going on my list of things that need to be improved
<@U1KRHCR7T>  so should we bring lunch to this meeting or are we getting some za?
no pizza unfortunately...the promotion is for tonight
