Hi yoga buds!
Well hi there!

Hi yogis! I go to a lot of studios in the area, if anyone wants to try any out outside of the NCSU gym let me know!
Well hi there!
@shelby  Is it a membership system or you can try out individual classes?
<@U1KQGK2CB>: i do a membership subscription called classpass, but you can try out any studio and your first time there is usually free or a reduced cost

Hitting up Indigo Hot Yoga tomorrow at 9am (located in Cameron Village). It's a 45min flow class if anyone wants to join... If you haven't been, I will say it is pretty intense but you can modify each pose to fit your level. They give you iced cold lavender towels at the end during savasana... Def makes the whole class worth it :raised_hands::skin-tone-4:
I'm doing yoga flow today at 5:15 if anybody is interested in joining

heading to wednesday flow at Blue Lotus Yoga (near Glenwood Ave) today at 4 (Blue gets out early) if anyone wants to join! It is not free like NCSU classes are :slightly_smiling_face: but there are student discounts. Highly recommend this studio if you are ever looking to try something new!
