It's my favorite everyone should come try it out

Y'all missed a chance to see Max drop it low
I am going to try Pound tomorrow
<@U1KRZT11T>: let me know what it's like. I'm super curious! 
I'm curious too Tommy! Sounded like a drum session from the studio next door!
It basically is
Ha! Is it mostly upper body work?
Even though you are drumming most of the time, you do lower body stuff as well
Interesting 
And you didn't feel like death afterwards?
Idk I haven't done it yet. I am basing in on the description
Oh! Oops -- I thought it was this morning!
Looking forward to your report back :slightly_smiling_face:
<@U1KRZT11T>: how was it?
<@U1KR9BP0E>: <@U1KQYG6SJ> l learned that I may be rhythmically challenged. I think that the class is worth trying because it is right up you alley. It wasn't the hardest workout I have ever done but it was a fun way to get moving 
Great! Thanks for letting us know!

<@U1KQYG6SJ>: if I'm alive then yes! 
My favorite Zumba instructor is teaching a class today at 5.30 if anyone wants to join!

:raised_hands::skin-tone-5:
Im doing Cycle &amp; Core @ 5:15 today if anyone wants to join :v:
Fail of the day: I went for my class (first time @ carmichael) and i thought everything was located in the same building. I asked the guy at the desk where studio D is and he said second floor. First staircase took me to bball courts, then i went back down and took another staircase to the running track. I asked another gorl working there wth is studio D and she said it's in a separate building. By the time I got to the rec center my class was half way done. I got pissed and went home and ate ice cream. I feel like such a disaster. <http://i.imgur.com/HN151LX.gif>
<@U1L7G5LR4>: dude. Been there
I was wondering where you were, next time
<@U1L7G5LR4>: ice cream is the solution to everything 
<@U1KRZT11T>: you went to two cycle classes today?
Ice cream is the solution to everything, that's why I eat so much. HIIT was full and I was just trying to support my buddy <@U1L7G5LR4> 
I'll make it next time! I think lol
<@U1L7G5LR4>:  :joy::joy::joy::joy::joy:
Anyone interested in going to HIIT or Cycle at 5:15 today?
Im in for cycling!
<@U1L7G5LR4>? Join us!
<@U1KR9BP0E>: I signed up. Hope I make it :skull:
Hey I've been wanting to try the cycle classes, but I'm second on the waitlist.  If the class is full does everyone usually show up?
It depends there norm are sometimes people don't show up. I would go any way just in case
What is HIIT?
high intensity interval training
dang, I'm on the cycle waitlist too
Thanks <@U1M1L5G6L> 
I'm doing Zumba today at 5:30 if anyone wants to dance instead of cycle! :dancer::skin-tone-2:
I'm on the waitlist for zumba <@U1L3G0YRJ> 
The teacher is pretty nice and might let you join even if it's full!
I'm doing a sweet personal plyometric workout at Miller field if anyone wants to join 
I had to drop my cycling class at 5:15 so hopefully those who wanted to get in, get it! I'm going to the 6:45 one :raised_hands:
WHY ARE THERE SO MANY COLLEGE KIDS AT THE GYM??!
Do any of you go to morning classes? If so where do you guys park? At paid parking? :thinking_face:
<@U1L7G5LR4>: I go in the mornings and park in the lot between the gym and Miller fields. I'm out of there about 7:30 and haven't had any tickets or anything yet. If you're gonna be there longer coliseum doesn't start charging until 7
<@U1KT5F4SZ> Thanks for replying! That's what I considered but I wasnt sure how crazy the parking police is lol
<@U1L7G5LR4>: I had been doing the same as Hannah but after I got unlucky and got a warning at 7:32 I've been going to the coliseum deck... but <@U1KRWUXFU> was parked next to me and didn't get  ticketed so who knows!
<@U1KRE5NKZ> I guess ill try it until i get a warning lol. Thanks!!
<@U1L7G5LR4>: I know <@U1L41DF9D> (Caroline Collins) said something about a non-peak parking pass you can buy for $63 that lets you park past 7.30, but you can ask her more about where that parking lot is and where to get the pass, if you're interested!
Anyone interested in going to anything tomorrow evening? There's Cycle Core at 5.15 but there's also Pilates at 5.15, which could be interesting.
Thanks <@U1KR9BP0E> ! I'll try my luck with 'free' parking at first until i get a ticket i guess
Tickets are hard to get appealed as it's an online process and they are $50 just FYI. You can park in any parking deck with the pass - collisuium, Dan Allen, pullen, etc. It basically extends the hours to 9am and then after 3pm instead of the usual 7am and 5pm. If you want more information just let me know! I got a ticket over the summer when I went around 7:30/8am so I decided not to push my luck anymore. 
There's a big cardio dance party tonight at 8pm! It'll be two studios combined, and 90 minutes of fun! About 20 spots left
10 spots left in tonight's cycle class at 5:15! who's with me?
6:30 cycle tomorrow morning :sunrise: 
<@U1L4RTKCM>: 6:30 running group tomorrow. Get on it

<@U1L6XBH6W> yay! Have you been to the class before? Iâ€™ve never been to barre at the nc state gym!
No I haven't either ! 
<@U1LBRCSEA>: I'd be down to do it! I used to take pure barre classes all the time and I miss it so much! 
<@U1L41DF9D> same! I was so excited to hear that nc state has their own barre classes!!!
Anyone going to cycling tomorrow morning?
<@U1KRB11QC> not tomorrow but let me know next time you go and I might join :slightly_smiling_face:
Zumba with Esdras. Tomorrow. 5.30pm. :fire: :bomb:
<@U1KQYG6SJ> is that class really zumba? I went to a zumba class last week and we didn't do any latin rhythms...
yeah... depends on the teacher
Esdras is from Honduras (from my stalking him) and generally keeps it pretty true to traditional Zumba
Ok, good to know!
there's one instructor I avoid because she doesn't really do Zumba. I'm blanking on her name right now, but she's pretty tiny
:smile:
I think she might be the one I had last friday...
Bailey is the tiny one!
Ah Bailey isn't great... 
I love Taylor tho I had her today and her playlists were awesome! 
I love Taylor's faces
Yea she's great
Power yoga at 5:15! :pray:
