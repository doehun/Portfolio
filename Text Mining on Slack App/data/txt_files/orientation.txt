I thought we could delete this channel at noon 
<@U1KQ9523D>: 
I just fell asleep 
you're not alone 
Lol same ^
He did 
<@U1KSPCE87>:

/giphy nightmare
<@U1KRZT11T>:  ^^^
These slides would never make it in our program. 
<@U1PM77VSS>: 
Story of my life
<@U1L3G0YRJ>: <@U1M1L5G6L> 
Good idea haha
<@U1KRLV1CG>: 
Sarah would tear these presentations apart
Did anyone notice how bad the presentation PowerPoints are? Font is too small, colors are bad, too much text 
If she were still here she would <@U1KT5F4SZ> 
Hannah, you beat me to it haha <@U1KT5F4SZ> 
No group sits like that around a table 
We should really incorporate more interactive theatre into our daily lives :+1::skin-tone-2:
<@U1L0RBZFH>: 
<@U1L6WB44A>: 
And without laptops? Definitely not. 
You guys are interrupting my studying!
Maybe dr. Race will incorporate interactive theater tomorrow 
<@U1L3G0YRJ>: would Sarah allow us to do interactive theater for our group presentations
I'm Sadi didn't create this channel 2 long, long hours ago 
sad
Too. Much. Text. 
Would we have to follow up our interactive theater with interactive questions and a conversation 
Lol
Memorize that policy!!! Quick!!!
Good grief the text
Soooooooo much text 
The fonts. My eyes. 
<@U1KRBJP47>: 
WHY ARE THERE ALL DIFFERENT FONTS 
/giphy my eyes
Those are our books for the next 5 weeks 
Yessss <@U1KRB11QC> that was perfect. 
So that we have it for future use haha
<@U1L95JP1S>: 
<@U1NLH1CP8>: 
Self plagiarism is an odd thing 
<@U1KRBFY3Z>: 
And for the jerks who sneaked out <@U1NUU2U9E> Appreciated! :slightly_smiling_face:
<@U1LDKB3AN>: 
<@U1KR891RC>: 
This guy is gonna be a handful in his Ph.D. Program. That's the 5th time he's got the mic
Lol <@U1KRMNVGC> 
What if you cite your own paper inside a citation from a paper you cited that you wrote and previously cited?!?
Paper inception 
Still self-plagiarism
In fairness, I invited <@U1KSEJ01W> to this channel@
Now <@U1KSEJ01W> won't know what to do if he has to write a paper similar to another papers he's written
Maybe <@U1KSEJ01W> is getting an inception type dream about self citing 
<@U1KSEJ01W>: is just preparing for data mining later today
I would like to put a citation that it was taken during the grad school orientation at NC state, Fall 2016
/giphy still sleeping
Can we all please photograph <@U1KSEJ01W> and see how many we can get?
<@U1KSEJ01W>: just getting roasted right now and has no idea
<@U1L95JP1S>: lean forward 
I'm so excited for when he wakes up and sees all of this. 
Creating this channel was a glorious idea. Thank you for saving us to whoever created it 
I did it <@U1KRMNVGC> 
We owe you one <@U1L6YQUSU> 
Can someone Download and Instacollage these?
Has <@U1KSEJ01W> looked at slack yet? 
He's awake!
Super nervous about picking my thesis y'all 
<@U1L46HXCJ>: killed it!
<@U1KT9ATA5>: 
4 presentations to go!
No way. We are done at 11:30, right?
This goes until noon 
My phone is about to die not sure how I'm going to survive this
We love you <@U1KSEJ01W> 
Thanks guys! :sob::sob::sob:
I need to improve my posture <@U1L46HXCJ> 
How many people have we lost to orientation :v:
Is there someone else asleep we can photograph relentlessly?
Great photo <@U1L46HXCJ> 
<@U1L46HXCJ>: haha -____-
3 more :neutral_face: (he said catch up which means we're behind) 
:heart_eyes: :heart_eyes: :heart_eyes: the library
Should we leave this channel up for the afternoon group? Or make them think of it themselves?
We need to delete so they don't all skip. They have to deal with this waste of three hours too
True.  Ill kill it at noon....or whenever we get out of this nightmare 
That picture is almost more of a nightmare than these last three hours 
True story <@U1KRMNVGC> 
The sign in thing was a joke right?
Yes.  I was jealous of <@U1KRLV1CG> 
<@U1KRE1L9M>: 
Remember everyone, hush hush from the afternoon group 
Well at least we got this stylish and high quality tote bag!
Oh yeah <@U1L3G0YRJ> 
With another bag inside. 
Hey I got a good nap out of it at least! 
I think there's a smaller bag inside the small bag 
Those look familiar 
They have us play babusca. We are talking true multiculturalism here
<@U1KS4UE2F>: 
<@U1KSEJ01W>: don't forget to download all your photos before I delete this channel 
Was that a banjo?
There's a few keepers in that bunch haha 
Her name is R Kelly
And she's giving the sexual harassment talk 
I feel like we're all trapped in the closet
This is too much.. 
Finally!!!  An agenda!!
But no chevron 
Smart girl <@U1NLH1CP8>
Not fair, <@U1NLH1CP8> 
Meanwhile I'm eating a nutri grain bar I found on the ground 
Good for you <@U1NLH1CP8> 
Three hours straight with no breaks is best practice right? We need to tell our professors they give us too many breaks 
Yes.  Massages are a southern thing 
I want to find that southern person who is always up for giving massages 
<@U1L7RPG1M> seems to like to (caught him giving <@U1NUU2U9E> a massage)
I think <@U1NUU2U9E> was ok with it.  <@U1L7RPG1M> offered him some sort of quid pro quo
Sexual advances on tinder? :scream: I'm shocked 
It was unwelcome to the recipient
<@U1L7RPG1M>: please self report 
I may have been ok with that
What was the spelling on Ha-Has?
Gotta watch out for those "slight" distinctions 
/giphy make it stop
Stat of the day: 95% of graduate students have never heard the term sexual misconduct 
Great use of an octopus for the sexual harassment talk.  
Never do live demos!!!
That's how I felt, <@U1L7RPG1M> 
The color blind people can't see the red C.
Upspeak on that last line. Poor form 
Hours during class time
/giphy Exodus
Anyone up for Zaxby's after this?
Sure! 
I think <@U1KSEJ01W> deserves a prize 
<@U1L6YQUSU>: that extra 45 minutes of sleep was more than enough of a prize for me 
Totes jelly 
A t-shirt is no compensation for what we've been through 
Everyone, it's been a pleasure sharing this channel with you 
Missed the T-shirt?:scream:
Can't wait for online orientation!!!
