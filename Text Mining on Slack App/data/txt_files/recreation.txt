Basketball at 1:30, courts 9-11 at Carmichael
I will be a few min late
Good playing with those who came out.  Look forward to seeing people at Bball tomorrow morning.
I know a lot of you have played basketball already but I'm planning to go to the gym and do the cardio dance class and after that (ends at 7:30) I was going to kick the soccer ball a little at the fields right next to the gym if anyone wanted to meet me there! 
I have an extra spot in my car if anyone needs a ride in the morning for basketball. Just let me know <tel:919-353-4199|919-353-4199>
Bball tomorrow morning?  9am-ish? Anyone interested?
Does anyone like to mountain bike or rock climb? 
<@U1MDHNYR5>: I took the rock climbing class here my freshman year (and I graduated last year) and I've really enjoyed climbing at our rock wall whenever I get a chance to go!! :blush:
I am not a great rock climber but I would enjoy going to the rock wall when it is open
I enjoy trying to climb it's always a lot of fun, but I am by no means a good climber.. :see_no_evil: I'd love to get better at it though!
I belong to triangle rock club and love rock climbing! Though I'm not the best :). 
The first time visiting is free so if we wanted to get a group together, I'd definitely be down! 
Awesome! I also have a TRC membership, though only for about another week or so. We should definitely get some people together to go! I'm also down to hit up the mc state wall too, but they are only open select hours on Tuesday, Thursday, and Sunday <@U1KRZT11T> <@U1L2P17DZ> <@U1L7E8GSU> 
:basketball: tomorrow after class at the gym if anyone else wants to play  
Volleyball? ... anyone???.. anytime?.... 
<@U1L40P4N9>: yes, me, this evening.  I expect to be free around 6.
A few of us in the email forum want to play volleyball tonight too.. does 6pm at Jaycee park work for everyone?
That sounds good. See you then!
I am going to end up passing on today, next time
So is anyone down to go rock climbing tomorrow? I was planning on going to Triangle Rock Club but could go to the NCSU wall if that's what people wanted to do.
How much does it cost to climb at the Rock Club/ can you rent gear? The rock wall here is free with gear you can borrow, so I'm up for that! But if the Rock Club isn't too expensive I'd be willing to give it a shot! I've only climbed here so it would be cool to go somewhere else
The first time you visit the Rock Club is free but it costs a little to rent gear (not too much).
I also have a spare harness and chalk bag that someone could use.
I am down for tomorrow for either
<@U1MDHNYR5> I'd go too haven't been climbing in a long time but always had a great time
6pm Jaycee Park. Copy that.
I'm mostly retired from climbing but I have gear someone can borrow.
So do you think we should go to the Morrisville TRC <@U1L7E8GSU> ? I haven't been to that one but I wouldn't mind checking it out.
Probably can't make volleyball today but I would love to get something going weekly ... indoor or outdoor 

<@U1MDHNYR5>: TRC Morrisville is bigger and has way higher walls. IMO bouldering is better at North Raleigh.
<@U1MDHNYR5>: I agree with <@U1M4QJD4P>.  But I haven't been to the state gym so can't compare to that! 
I'm also belay certified so can belay people. 
State gym is modeled after real climbs in the NC mountains, there aren't the plastic handholds because you use the cracks/jugs/formations in the rock to the climb like in real outdoor climbing. It has a good range of easy climbs to difficult climbs and you're allowed to Boulder as well. You do have to take a quick belay certification test but it's straight forward! I've passed it every time there. Google NCSU rock wall to see pictures if you want!
I'm belay certified too at TRC, but I can't make it tomorrow, let me know next time ya'll go!
Ok! Well I vote we go to Morrissville tomorrow and then I would be down to check out the ncsu wall on Sunday if anyone else wants to go! I got my belay certification there like a week ago but don't have it at TRC yet. 

Would  5 or 6 pm work for people?
Yea I would be down but would most likely need a ride
TRC-Morrisville at 6? <@U1L2P17DZ> <@U1MDHNYR5> <@U1KRZT11T> and anyone else who wants to come?
Lets do it! And <@U1KRZT11T> I can give you a ride
I can come too! Maybe a quick power nap after class to try and wake up :wink: <@U1MDHNYR5> did you still have an extra harness available?
I do! i'll bring it with me <@U1L2P17DZ>
Correlation is cool 
Remember that correlation does not imply causation!
<@U1L7E8GSU>: <@U1MDHNYR5> <@U1KRZT11T> I'm actually not feeling so hot this afternoon, I may sit this session out... But I'm definitely up for Sunday if you're going then too!
<@U1L2P17DZ>: Oh no!  I hope you feel better.
sorry to hear that! <@U1L2P17DZ>
<@U1L2P17DZ>: hope you feel better
Thanks guys, you all have fun tonight! I'm coming next time!!
<@U1L7E8GSU>: we are on our way   But will be about 15 late
<@U1L8PJY4W>: HIIT was fun. Hopefully you'll be able to come next time!
<@U1KT5F4SZ>: ahhhh I'm sitting here stuffed from dinner totally regretting my choice to bail on the gym! Def want to try it next week!!
<@U1L8PJY4W>: you're not alone. I bailed on the gym too. 
:-1::skin-tone-4:
Haha <@U1KR9BP0E> You make me feel better :grinning::grinning::grinning:
Anybody wanna play soccer this saturday or sunday? 
<@U1KRNHQA1>: definitely
<@U1KRNHQA1>: I could probably play Sunday late afternoon
I'm down to play Sunday anytime after the euro final
How's Sunday at 6pm for everyone? 
<@U1KRNHQA1>: sounds good to me! 
Anyone interested in walking Lake Johnson on Saturday morning? I'm going to go there weekly and gradually build up to jogging the entire loop. I'm going to aim to arrive at 10am at the boat house.
<@U1KRNHQA1>: I'm definitely down
For those who slept in this morning.  I'll be playing bball at ~5 today at the gym.
<@U1KRNHQA1>: I'll be there! Sunday at 6pm at Miller fields?
yeah! are the Miller fields always open?
I think on the weekend Miller Fields are open. Daily hours are here: <https://recreation.dasa.ncsu.edu/facilities/facilities-hours/>
We should all watch the game together at the London Bridge pub with <@U1L914KNJ> , then go play soccer after the game
<@U1KRNHQA1>: When are you guys heading to the pub today? 
<@U1MDHNYR5>: gonna get there a little before 3! If anyone needs a ride just let me know
London bridge opens at 2 today, game starts at 3. I'll probably get there 2:15-2:30. Allez les bleus!
:flag-pt::flag-pt::flag-pt:
Awesome. I'll meet you guys there around 2:40!
Just a reminder, soccer at miller fields at 6!
We will be playing soccer at miller fields Sundays at 5. All are welcome! Also, make sure to start thinking about good (terrible) team names. I'll start it off with may the odds ratio be ever in your favor
Proc score!
Anyone up for bball today? 
<@U1L974M70> Yes, what time?
Just after 4.
Same courts?
<@U1MDE4NAG>: yeah.  Ran a couple errands.  Walking up now.
I'm going to Zumba at 6.30 at the gym today! Leaving from IAA if anyone wants to join.
<@U1L0V1X61>: and I will be at Yoga tomorrow at 6:30pm at 	Carmichael Recreation Center, Studio A! Would love to have anyone else join us
<@U1KQGK2CB> &amp; <@U1L0V1X61>: I just signed up for Yoga too. This is only my second yoga class ever but I'm excited.
<@U1KR9BP0E>:  Awesome! I am glad you can join :slightly_smiling_face:
How do you sign up! <@U1L0V1X61> <@U1KQGK2CB> <@U1KR9BP0E> 
<@U1L0V1X61>: didn't you say we can just show up? 
<@U1L9DD1NY>: you go to <http://imleagues.com|imleagues.com> and sign up for an account. then you click on 'group fitness' and you'll see all the classes. if you try and just show up you might be on the waitlist and they're pretty strict about that.
<@U1L9DD1NY>: if you have trouble signing up online you can also just call them and ask to be added i think.
<@U1L9DD1NY>: You should sign up online if you can. If you are not able to, then you can call, or just show up and she will register you onsite as long as the class is not full (and it usually is not).
My account still has not been completely "activated" yet. I need to go to the services desk and figure out what's going on.  But I usually show up and register at the class itself
Okay thank you :-)
<@U1L0V1X61>: mine was having a lot of issues too - someone helped me fix it today and now it's working great.  It was a girl called Katie - you could ask for her.
<@U1KR9BP0E>: did you call, or did you go to the desk to get it done?
Anyone who wants to play basketball tomorrow, bring your stuff! I'll be heading over to the gym right after class 
Anyone interested in getting some tennis going? I'm rusty but I enjoyed playing it in high school.
<@U1M37FW5U>: I just sort of started playing last year and am a total beginner! But if you don't mind i would be down. I don't have my racket and would have to buy one though- but I can do that. 
Is ball life?... If you answered yes to that question please join the hoops channel. That is all.
I'd be up for tennis sometime
<@U1KR9BP0E>: I've never done it, but I believe you can check out tennis rackets at Carmichael.
<@U1KR9BP0E>: And beginners are welcome! I am pretty rusty myself.
I would be down for tennis as well
When are you guys playing? I love to play tennis!
I play tennis too!
I was thinking tomorrow or Friday?
I'm up for tennis too, I love to play
Join the tennis channel to coordinate stuff!
Hey all - just created a yoga channel to coordinate yoga stuff
Just a reminder--soccer Sundays, 5pm, Miller fields
Any #runners in the area looking to run as a group?  I am a member of the nog run club  which meets 6:15 on Mondays at the Raleigh Beer Garden.  It is a great organization and there are routes of varying distances.  The Beer Garden also offers discounts on food after you run!
<http://www.nogrunclub.com/>
Hey Sean I'd be interested in linking with you on that.  I used to go to the nog club back when they were still at tir na nog. These days I often go Raleigh brewing run club on Wednesdays.
Sean is it 6:15 am or pm?
6:15 pm 
Are people still playing soccer at 5 today?
Yes
But playing at armory fields as Miller field is closed because of yesterday's rain
Parking is on fraternity court near Greek village 
Everyone come break from studying and play!
Missed this, I will try to play next Sunday
^Same here
Is anyone going to the nog run tonight?  Let me know as I don't always stick around for dinner but might if people are running. 
Anyone want to go for a run at Umstead Sunday morning
I'd be up for that. How far of a run? 
We don't have to have a set length but maybe 4-7 ish. Does that seem fair?
Anyone coming to Umstead tomorrow we are going to meet at 8 at the Reedy Creek entrance, any pace welcome.

Hi! As I've mentioned to a few people I'm planning on running a half marathon in Raleigh on October 8th.  I thought  I'd post the race info to see if anyone was interested or wanted to train with me .  Below is the webpage for any information you'd want to know.  Let me know if you're interested!
Yo yo yo
<https://race131.com/races/race-13-1-raleigh-nc-fall/details>
<https://media.giphy.com/media/Vccpm1O9gV1g4/giphy.gif>
I'm interesting in running the half marathon. How do you plan on training?
There is also the City of Oaks Full and Half Marathon which is a little bit later (Sunday, November 6th) <http://cityofoaksmarathon.com/>
Cool. I’m most likely running the City of Oaks Half. I hadn’t heard of the Raleigh 13.1 but maybe I’ll do that as well.
If you're behind on your training schedule, there's also one the next weekend (November 12th and 13th) along the Outer Banks! Robin is running it (I'm clearly not a runner) and we could totally travel out there together! He was sold on the fact that there are basically no hills :+1:  <http://www.outerbanksmarathon.com/>
Haha <@U1NDG6ULB> ! My thought exactly! Y'all have some  guts! Good luck to everyone that attempts this :muscle:
I'm thinking about the city of oaks half as well <@U1KQGK2CB> <@U1KRHCR7T> <@U1M37FW5U> should we make a group training plan? 
I just signed up for the 13.1 because I won a raffle for free entry.  I could be convinced to do the city of oaks as well, since in theory I'll just have to stay in shape for another month :slightly_smiling_face:.  <@U1M37FW5U>  In terms of training I think the real challenge will be staying consistent through the ebs of the flows of the program.  I'm going to try to have at least one long run and two short runs per week with cross training built in as time allows.
When is the Krispy Kream run?
February I believe
<@U1L974M70>: yeah it's February I'm pretty sure. I did it the last couple years but have never eaten more than 3 donuts. Maybe this year I'll try more! 
Soccer Sunday Miller fields, 5pm

In the words of a wise man who loves to flip his hair back, beware causation vs correlation
Tennis tomorrow, Carmichael, 8am. 
Hey everyone . I have talked to a lot of people who want to start running or want a place to meet up, but are afraid they will be "too slow" and not have people to run with. My goal is to create a running group that would be inclusive for everyone, and get the IAA together! This Tuesday morning at 6:30 A.M. will be the first group run starting at the institute. I have mapped out a four mile loop for everyone to follow that is attached below. If you are worried this distance is too far (or not far enough) for you currently , don't worry, the route can easily be altered to fit your current level of fitness. I will be staying with the person at the end to make sure no one gets lost. I hope to see some people Tuesday morning!  <http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/1227196714>
<@U1KRZT11T>  sounds like fun, I'm IN
Me too.
#in
Going to Zumba step today at 6:45 if anyone wants to join! 
I know it's selfish but I can't make it Tuesday's.. Would anybody be against moving Tuesday morning run club to Wednesday mornings next week?
<@U1KRZT11T> i'll be there in the morning as well. I'd be interested in doing group runs in the morning 2-3 times per week. I'm open for any day pending our schedules
<@U1KRZT11T>: where are we meeting in the morning? 
<@U1KT5F4SZ>: Meeting right in front of IAA
If i hear my alarm in the morning, I'll be there. 
Alright I'll give this "way too early in the morning" thing a try
For anybody that's interested there's a free class for "Race Ready Running Conditioning @ Miller Fields Fit Ground" tomorrow at 6:30 am.. 10 spots left I just signed up.. Figured I'd do it since it's free this time around
I'm doing a HEAT class tomorrow at 5:30 pm at a place called Heat Studios on Glenwood Ave. HEAT= Highly effective athletic training. They have a deal $25 for an unlimited amount of classes for two weeks if anyone is interested in signing up. The website is <http://heatstudios.com/>.
<@U1L0RBZFH> I can't this friday, but let me know how it goes tomorrow and I will probably join you next time!
<@U1L0RBZFH>: <@U1L41DF9D> same! Can't go this Friday, but I'd love to go! 
<@U1KRWUXFU> <@U1L0RBZFH> agreeing with all of this!
<@U1L41DF9D> <@U1KRWUXFU> <@U1L7E8GSU> Awesome!! I'll let you all know how it goes.
There's a "tough howler" on the iml website, anybody interested in giving it a go?
Soccer 5pm Sunday, Miller Fields
Golf at Lochmere this afternoon if anyone's interested. Right now it's just <@U1PF7HWTF> and I so there's still spots
anyone interested in hiking this weekend?
<@U1KRHCR7T>: what day were you thinking about going?
no plans yet, just gauging interest
yeah, hiking at Umstead could be fun
I am tentatively in, with the family, depending on the trail and time
<@U1KRHCR7T>  where do you usually go hike around here?
I would be up for hiking as well 
<http://m.indyweek.com/indyweek/the-triangle-has-lots-of-great-hiking-trails-here-are-seven-of-our-favorites/Content?oid=5060071>
<@U1L1WFNC8> I’ve only hiked at Umstead thus far. But I’ve heard good things about Raven Rock State Park, though it’s a bit more of a drive (just under an hour). And obviously lots of other good options too
I have 2 tickets to the football game tonight that I'm not using. They are about 10 rows behind the visitor bench, at midfield. I'll accept the most intriguing offer. Direct message me here if you're interested
<@U1KRHCR7T>, is hiking still happening this weekend?
Tomorrow looks like a perfect day for hiking. Anyone up for doing a easy/moderate hike at Umstead? maybe starting at 10am or so? <@U1N43E3E0> <@U1KRNTXL5>
Soccer Sunday Miller fields, 5pm
Also, would anyone be up for soccer Monday at 5? I can't make tomorrow because of the notre dame game. Go Irish! 
<@U1KRHCR7T> <@U1N43E3E0> <@U1KRWUXFU> , just saw your messages--I'd be up for hiking at Umstead tomorrow morning.  But if that's too short notice, tomorrow afternoon or Monday works also.  <tel:205-919-8928|205-919-8928>
Hey <@U1KRHCR7T> <@U1KRNTXL5> I don't think I can go on short notice. I really need to get some work done today :(. I'm down for going some other time though.
<@U1KRE1L9M> that actually works better for me anyway
<@U1N43E3E0> No worries, looks like today doesn’t work for many people so I’ll try to organize something another time
No pick up soccer today, Miller fields are closed. <@U1KRZT11T> <@U1L914KNJ> 
ok
Soccer Sunday, Miller fields, 5pm
Anyone want to play some disc golf or a quick 9 of regular golf?
Tomorrow I would be down 
Soccer Sunday, Miller fields, 5pm (I'll be coming back from a wedding, so I won't be there)
Will anyone be at soccer today? If no one is going I will just go on a run instead
I won't be there today

I will be there
Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna make it today but have fun! 
Soccer Sunday, Miller fields, 5pm
Fyi to all of you that play Soccer Sunday.... Miller fields are closed today
