Some plans thus far: Renting camping equipment from the school because it is dirt cheap (<https://recreation.dasa.ncsu.edu/outdoor-adventures/equipment-rental-center/>). Hiking in either Nantahala or Dupont. Looking for large campsite
Campsite is booked!!! Thanks <@U1KRB11QC> for finding the spot! We have a group site at Briar Bottom Campground (holds 30-50 people) for Saturday night, October 15.
Who is interested in renting a tent from NCSU Recreation? Please react by tonight so that we can get them reserved. James and I will organize the rental and determine the cost of the trip soon (Expected to be $15.00)
I need a tent
I have a tent that claims to hold 4, but probably 3 comfortably
I have 4 (really 3) and 2 person tents. And a bunch of sleeping bags and camping equipment (stove lantern etc...). Also my uncle lives nearby and he might have some stuff we can borrow as well 
More carpool info/plans to come later, but like this if you can drive (and have a large-ish car). 
I have a 4 person tent somewhere and some camping equipment 
I have an "8-person" tent that could hold 4 people comfortably, and I could drive my smallish car.
