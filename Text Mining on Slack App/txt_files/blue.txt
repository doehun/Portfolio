Congratulations <#C1KR7U5N3|blue> team we made it through the first two days!
Double checking- today is an optional study hall for SAS? 
from what I understood, yes
Thanks, <@U1L7ERY77> !
Ok friends---  As you heard earlier this week, we are collecting school supplies to donate to Centennial Campus Magnet Middle School.  Kimberly G., Sharon W. and I are helping to coordinate things and we thought it would be fun to turn it into a competition BLUE vs. ORANGE cohorts. We're going to place a box in each classroom for you to put items in.  One item= one point.  The cohort with the most points wins!  We need the supplies dropped off in the boxes no later than Thursday, July 28th. Winner gets bragging rights... LET THE GAMES BEGIN!:dancer:
Ooooo yes, I love a challenge! Let's do this Blue team :medal:
Hey is any one in the class? I think I might have left my wireless mouse. 
Did anyone see a wireless mouse in the conference rooms near the blue cohort classroom? :sweat_smile:
Laura says we need the Enterprise Miner book for today! If you took it home, make sure to bring it in!
Hey blue!  Donuts are waiting for you.
Does anyone have an iPhone charger I could use during the next class?

Has anyone found the solution video Dr. Race was going to post? Is it up yet?
I don't think she's posted it yet <@U1L3G0YRJ>. I
I'm going to ask her some questions today so I'll gently remind her :wink:
In the beginning of SQL class today, Andrea showed a powerpoint with the breakdown of what Elearnings go with each SAS Certification. Does anyone know what powerpoint that was?
I think she said it was in the "SAS Certification Process" from bootcamp!
All in favor of:   Dr. Christopher Healey - Rabbit Commander

This classroom smells amazing.
Does anyone who sits near me happen to know if I left a wallet in the classroom today :eyes:

Hey guys!  Laura put out the information to complete peer evals on our desks and said we can start on them now to get them out of the way.  So if you're on campus and want to get those finished quickly so you can keep studying for the test, you have the option.
<@U1L7E8GSU> Do you know if we're doing evals for both practicum and homework teams?
Yup, we are
Donuts are waiting for you, Blue Cohort
Does anyone not want their footrest?
