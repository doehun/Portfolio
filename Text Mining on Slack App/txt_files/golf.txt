Anyone wanna play this week? 
I'd be down to play but I'm in option 1 communications so it's need to be Thursday or Friday
Anybody want to hit up knightsplay tomorrow evening?
It's a par 3 course and has lights to play when the sun goes down
I'll be down in the future, but I have SAS this Friday so I'll be studying. 
Same here. I'd be down for hitting up the driving range tonight as a break from studying  and maybe hit up a course after the test is over
should we golf this afternoon?
i like the idea, but i'm gonna have to take a rain check, i'm not feeling so well
sounds good hope you feel better man

Let's play Saturday
We could play scramble so it won't matter who's amazing and who sucks haha
Brewery tour yo. otherwise I'd say Saturday would work
Does anyone want to play golf tomorrow morning? I know a nice place, and I can get you on for free. Message me directly if you'd like to play. First 1 or 2 to message me win! haha
