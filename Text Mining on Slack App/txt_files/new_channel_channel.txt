whoa whoa. Easy there <@U1L7ERY77>.  If you don't have a new channel to share then you are spamming. Thank you <@U1L3G0YRJ>, that's good to know and proper use of this channel.
<@U1M4QJD4P>: says the spam poster
Praising proper usage and scolding others of improper use is also permitted. Well done <@U1KT9ATA5>.
:joy: 
Thank you for making this <@U1M4QJD4P>.  I'm planning a series of new channels just so I can utilize this forum.
