Hey everyone. Just a quick pitch about the idea. I want to meet somewhere between once/week and once/month, depending on everyone's schedule. Basically the idea of Junto is mutual improvement. We can figure out the specifics at our first meeting (if there are people interested in meeting), but essentially we would get together for 30 minutes to an hour to discuss books we're reading, current events, articles we've seen, movies, television shows...whatever you want. As long as you're making an attempt to be insightful. The questions on the Wiki page ( <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junto_(club)> ) are a good guideline. Please let me know if you are interested through this channel, and we can start planning our first meeting!
<!channel> Ok, we have six people! That is enough to get this puppy going. Can everyone meet tomorrow (Thursday) at noon? Super informal, just to talk about what we want to do.
Yes
Ok, since there is a CIA interest meeting at 12:15, let's move this meeting back to 12:30. I will be in the kitchen at that time. If that time doesn't work for you, please let me know. My number is 443 562 9232.
