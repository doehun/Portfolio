For all that love to ball
On my way there now.
:basketball:
Breaking up my studying today with some :basketball: ..be there around 3 
Ball today after class/tests ..if we can get at least 6-8 people I'm down to hit up the outdoor courts. Been cooped up inside too much the past few days.
Let's get a squad to play tomorrow around 6 at the gym. Like the comment if you're down. 
ill play after class today
but if it conflicts with bowling, we can go ball tmrw
I'm down to play tomorrow as well. Wasn't expecting that test to take me 3 hours hah
Let's plan on playing tomorrow. I need beer this afternoon not basketball.  
I'm heading to play basketball in 30 minutes! Hope to see some of y'all there 
I think most people are going at 6pm today
<@U1L3PU7BJ>: ^
I think there's an earlier bunch going at 5! I have plans at 6:30 <@U1MDE4NAG> thanks! 
:ok_hand::skin-tone-4:
Indoors or outdoors today?
I vote indoors
I was gonna lift but I think I'll just head straight to the courts. Anyone there already? 
Only one court open indoors 
I'll be up there until 7
If we have enough, it'll be easier to play outside. Indoor is packed  
I'll be at the outside courts soon 
We are heading to the outdoor courts
Friday basketball will be at 9am this week per Brandon's post in the Google Group
Bball today anyone?
I would play if others would
Headed to the gym now 
<@U1KRE1L9M>: are you related to Richard Sherman 
Does anyone know if we're still playing at 9 tomorrow morning?
Or is that Friday?
Nvm ignore that. LaBarr and Brandon are gonna play tomorrow at 12:30 
Basketball? 3:30? 
<@U1L3PU7BJ>: can't today.  Anyone interested in hooping this wknd?  Maybe tomorrow mid-day?
Maybe on Sunday? 
I can't tomorrow... Beer bourbon BBQ festival :beer: 
<@U1KT9ATA5> I'm down for Sunday
I'm good for Sunday as well
Sunday what time?
How about 10-12? Or 12-2?
I could do 10-12
Let's do it 
Anyone else? 
Doesn't look like we have enough. Maybe later this week 
I'm going, will just shoot around at the least <@U1KT9ATA5> 
No more camps! All courts open! 
Realizing I may be a week late with this info but it's about time 
I'm heading over there soon if anyone wants to join!
Anyone want to ball tomorrow at 7am? LaBarr and Brandon are out this week so it's on us to plan it.
I'll be there
That's so early for a non-school day haha
I'll be there, too. 
Come <@U1MDE4NAG> ! It will be fun!
This is what will separate the men from the boys. Which will you be?
Well I don't have a car currently haha
<@U1KR80QMS>: 
Where do you live?
13427 Melvin Arnold rd, Raleigh, NC 27613
Haha, <@U1MDE4NAG> I'm totally kidding. No pressure, but it'd be great to see you there
Haha I know... I live way out of the way, so I'll probably be out this time 
Sounds good
Can we do like... 10
I was thinking with all the people not haven taken SAS we could have a bigger group after Friday
perhaps a good Saturday morning ball session
Or after the sas review session 
I'm down for after the review session
Like we did last week
Bball tomorrow anyond?
<@U1L974M70>: I think the review session is tomorrow. How are you after the session (12:30pmish I believe)?
<@U1KS4UE2F>: yeah, 1230 sounds good.
12:30 should work for me
See you guys there 
Works for me as well
I'll be there 
What courts?

Where do you live 
<@U1KS4UE2F>:

<@U1KT9ATA5>: i live at 1520 crest road
<@U1KS4UE2F>, Amir and I will be there in 10
<@U1MDE4NAG>: thanks! u guys save lives
<@U1KS4UE2F>: we're here
The upper courts all have volleyball nets up, courts 1-8 are open tho
Cool.  Be there in 15.
Planning on Saturday at 1230 again
I think I could do tomorrow at 12:30 too. Are others coming?
I'll be there
Anybody want to play today at 2 or 3?
I can't today 
I'm trying to get a sense of how many we will have tomorrow at 12:30. So far it's me, <@U1KRE1L9M> and <@U1KT9ATA5> . If you're planning on it do you Mind responding so we can see how many we have? Thanks!
If it's just us three I may hang back... Not worth the 45 minute drive 
Tagging the people who posted recently--anyone up for basketball at 12:30? <@U1L974M70>  <@U1NDG6ULB> <@U1L90S3QC> <@U1L3PU7BJ>  <@U1KSL7L7R> <@U1KS4UE2F> <@U1KSH8676>  <@U1LLWQ02E> <@U1KRSV7AN> <@U1MDE4NAG> <@U1LMHQY9E> <@U1KRTHAQZ> <@U1LDKB3AN>
I'm not gonna be able to play today 
I could be there if we will have enough people
I can't today
Can't today.. Maybe we can get enough for Monday  
I can play today if others do as well
I'm in!
Sweet. I'm in too independent of the numbers. I want to get some exercise in. 
So far it looks like we have six if Amir makes the trek. 
I also texted a buddy of mine to see if he wanted to. So we may have 7
sounds great
for the future, if anyone wants to play on short notice and wants to see if others would be up for it, my cell is <tel:724-986-1018|724-986-1018>--if you want to be in that texting group feel free to add your number

We're on the second floor courts.

What time are you thinking?
<@U1KRE1L9M> <@U1KR80QMS> anytime really. How about 5? 
Works for me. <!channel> basketball at 5 today 
<@U1KRE1L9M>: <@U1L3PU7BJ> i dona think I'll make it today guys.
Count me in. What courts?
I'm in 
I'm in too
I'll be there 
Yay! See y'all at 5. The second floor courts 
We're on court 1
Be there in a bit .. 5:45
I emailed Labar and Brandon about playing tomorrow morning at 8 am since we don't have class until 10:30. So far Brandon is down 
I'll be there probably a couple minutes late, doing a class from 7-8
I'd be down, if we can't get enough I'm also up for playing tonight.
I'm in for tomorrow morning 
i'm in for tomorrow morning
Tomorrow morning works for me 
Ill be there
In.
ditti
ditto
I'm down
Got a doctor's appointment at 8:30 so I can't make it. If anyone wants to ball on the weekend I'm down. 
I'm down
For tomorrow morning
I too am available and willing to play basketball tomorrow, August 18th, 2016, at 8:00 am at the NCSU physical fitness facilities.
In other words, I'm down
Should be there around 815, let me know what courts you guys are on
 On 9 and 10 right now 
Ok cool 
Hell0.. Orange has a late start tomorrow but Blue does not. Are there people in Blue that would like to play tomorrow morning at 7 am? 
Blue vs Orange bball game needs to happen.
<@U1L3PU7BJ> I'd be in.
If we don't have enough, would people be interested in after class at 5 tomorrow instead?
I'm down for the morning. I can't after 5
So who's in for tomorrow?
<!channel> I am up for tomorrow morning or tomorrow at 5
<!channel>: I'm in
For the morning
I'm 50% right now 
Anyone wanting to play tomorrow?
<!channel>: I'm interested if we played early (e.g. 8:00 am). Come on guys! Who's in??
I'm down
Morning works for me. 
Crazies
<@U1KR80QMS> and <@U1KRTHAQZ> I'd still be down to play tomorrow morning if y'all are. I figure there will be people playing and we could just run together. Let me know. 
<!channel>: sounds good. I'm in 
I'm in.
Don't think it opens until 9am today though. 
Ok
<!channel> anyone else in now that we are playing at 9?
<@U1KR80QMS>: y'all still playing?
Yup
We're on the second floor. Court 3. 
basketball today? anyone?
I can play after 5.
<http://www.theonion.com/article/study-links-clinical-depression-getting-dunked-52672>
<!channel> bball around 1230 on Friday?
We might need to spend Friday afternoon meeting our practicum teams, right?
I'd say make it 1:30 or 2, for lunch purposes
Today at 4? 
Or 5 
I'm in
dont have my bball shoes otherwise i'd play
How about Friday afternoon Blue vs Orange???
what're the squads: blue - brian, mike, dustin, edward, amir, nick, rocky, carson, jordan
colby
also colby, florian, and mike hruska!
<!channel>  amir edward daniel and I are going to play...we were thinking around 2:30/3:00 and if youre in orange just go whenever you get out and I'll still be there
only after 5 works for me...
Team Orange: Nils, Pranav, Chris, Kevin, Eric, John, Daniel, Phil, Diego (if you aren't listed, I didn't mean to cut you from our team)
I agree with Daniel that Friday afternoon may not be ideal especially for those wanting to meet with their practicum teams. Does Friday early morning work?
Friday morning usual time works for me
I vote Friday morning
. Friday morning works for me. 
Agree for Friday morning
I'll be going at like 2pm
<@U1MDE4NAG>: same here, depending on when python class might be 
I like Friday morning too because we have the court to ourselves. Also, Brandon and Dr Labarr will be there, and we can still meet practicum teams, go to python training, etc.
After taking the quiz for Python, I don't know if the Friday afternoon class will be worth it. And playing at 2pm still gives time for meetings 
Looks like the class is 1-2:30, do maybe play after?
<@U1MDE4NAG> i'm good for 2 or earlier. my team is meeting this afternoon
 Can we have a vote for early times and late times tomorrow? Personally I'd like everyone there so we can do the blue v orange game. My vote is 6:30 am
6:30
I prefer morning but don't have a problem with the afternoon #decisive 
<!channel>: I'll vote after class today. I want to ask Dr. Healey about the python class tomorrow
leaning heavily toward afternoon though
Oh I can't play today 
<@U1LMHQY9E>: I meant I won't vote until after class, sorry for the confusion 
Please vote with a thumbs up reaction
Friday 6:30 am
Friday afternoon
<@U1LMHQY9E> switch back
K
Sorry guys won't be able to make it to the blue vs Orange game, been sick all day. 
Now that our practicum team is meeting during lunch, I can do either time
<@U1KSH8676> c'mon man you were the one that proposed the idea!
I'm down to play either times however when I went to play around 4 last Friday I had to wait two games before I could get next. Volleyball and bad-mitten were taking up half of the courts.
So basketball tomorrow morning? 
<@U1L3PU7BJ> we played yesterday around 3 and there were plenty of courts open
Maybe Friday afternoons are when volleyball and bad mitten go on but I am down to check it out 
I know my practicum team is meeting during lunch tomorrow. So I'm fine with either time now. 
Ok so it seems evenly split between morning and afternoon. We should just choose when O v B is happening and go with it.
Has anyone discussed this with Brandon / Dr. LaBarr so if afternoon is chosen they don't show up in the morning? I can only do morning so that's why I voted for it
I sent them an email but have not received an email yet
There are 3 "double votes", could you guys pick one or the other? 
The suspense is killing me :slightly_smiling_face:
But I suppose this is a good exercise in conflict management and communication
I'm really liking the open and honest communication going on here to resolve this conflict. Good job team.
Perhaps we should choose a <#C1RD90DQU|hoops> team lead... That way he or she could make the call
Not everyone can do both, so everyone should just go when they want. It looks like we'll have numbers for both time slots 
They won't have enough to run full if some of us go to the afternoon...if 10 can commit to the morning then whoevers left can go together in the afternoon and pick up randos
I'll be there in the morning
I'll be there in the morning too
labarr is not playing im guessing neither is brandon
morning for me
and a buddy of mine (not in the program) is coming too
I'll be there in the morning. 
Evening!
People who can do both, are you willing to play in the morning and the afternoon? 
Also <@U1Q5GHC2J> are you gonna play in the morning? 
ill play morning
The reason I'm asking is cause I'm down to play both times. And if everyone who is free for both does that then we have 9 people for morning and evening. We'd just need one more person who can do that also 
I'll play tomorrow morning
I'll be there in the morning and afternoon. I could use the exercise haha 
ill play in the morning. then ill see about the afternoon
given i play in the morning i have a 40% chance of playing in the afternoon
See you all in the morning.
I'll play in the morning too
is it 6:30?
Yep
were on courts 9-11
i'm out for this afternoon
Pick-up game starts at 1pm(EST).
Anyone interested in a 9am game tomorrow?
 I'm not for sure - just trying to gauge interest. 
Friday morning peeps?
I'm in
I'm in
uggggggggggggghhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Yup
Friday morning let's try to finally get that B v O game man
plenty of time to catch up on sleep on the long weekend
also...we get out early (2pm) just sayin
are people leaving after class for labor day weekend? if that's not the case, afternoon is also a good option

But let's do afternoon next Friday. We get out at noon
Hi guys, I'm planning to lend my height to the hoops cause. What time tomorrow are you guys playing?  How does it work with parking and stuff - should I try to carpool in?
Well hi there!
We are playing at 6:30 <@U1MPXSHN1>. Parking is either 3 or 4$. There are showers there and you can rent towels for free with your ID card. Let me know if you have more questions!
can somebody lend this poor soul a ride tomorrow? 
<@U1KS4UE2F>: I will if you text me and remind me tonight haha
<tel:919-413-9511|919-413-9511>
<@U1MDE4NAG>: are you caving in for morning?? 
Yep! I'm weak, I know
were on court 8
<!channel>: ^
Tomorrow morning gentleman?
Afternoon gentlemen?
celebrate the panthers win
^is the ? for you thinking the broncos have a chance tonight? or is it just confusion as to how playing basketball in the morning is not a proper way to celebrate the results of a football game
I might play tonight and I'm down to play either time tomorrow. Brandon is not playing this week but I'm not sure about Dr. LaBarr
Labarr and I are in for the morning tomorrow
<!channel>: ^
<@U1PF7HWTF>: I'll be enjoying a Broncos win. But there will be no need to celebrate, we're used to winning
I'll be there in the morning
Panthers suck
^False

I'll be there, too. 
i guess so too :confused:

if nick comes in the morning (nick come!)
Yeah I am 
I'm out for hoops tomorrow. I forgot my shoes broke last time haha
<!channel>: can I ride with anyone from the Institute to the gym in the morning 
I can pick you up Amir. I'll pick you up at 6:25.

I'm at the deck now

Sorry guys not going to make it this morning 
I'm playing at around 1pm this afternoon. 
<@U1L974M70> I'm playing at 2:30 if you want to wait
I'll be heading over at more like 120
