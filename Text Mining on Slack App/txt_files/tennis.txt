I haven't played in a long time, but I'm up for tennis!! I have a couple of extra rackets I could bring :)
I think i have an extra as well.
What's better for everyone? Tomorrow or Friday?
Friday is a little better for me
Friday is better for me too! Are there courts on campus?
I have not played in forever either and am a real beginner. Was just starting to learn before I moved here. <@U1L2QDX7Y> could I borrow a racket? I'd be down for Friday after class.
<@U1KQTJ6BV>: there are courts outside carmichael rec center. Do any of you know if these need to be reserved ahead of time?
I could not figure out how to reserve a court.
I can't make it Friday :'(  but I could bring a racquet to class for you <@U1KR9BP0E> 
I have one more racquet too I just don't think the strings will last very long 
<@U1L2QDX7Y>: that would be awesome! I can give it back to you on Monday? I have one in DC I can bring down the next time I go up there, at the end of July.
yeah that works, I'll bring it to class on Friday <@U1KR9BP0E> 
Is tennis tomorrow still happening? I'd also be down for saturday or sunday if the courts are open on weekends...
I would be down for doing it this weekend
I can play tomorrow or this weekend as well 
I can play tomorrow or this weekend as well. The courts at nc state are open on the weekends and are first come, first serve.
Pun intended?
lets do saturday or sunday morning before it gets too hot? maybe 9?
ha, nice one <@U1KRZT11T>
Pun intended :slightly_smiling_face:
Saturday of sunday at 9:00 sounds good to me. I prefer Saturday but I can do Sunday as well 
I'm up for tomorrow afternoon (if anyone else is) and Saturday morning.
Seems like the preference that works for everyone is sunday morning at 9 am.  See you guys at the courts!
oops i mean SATURDAY MORNING at 9:00 am, sorry!
<@U1KRZT11T>: I have an extra racquet I can bring for you tomorrow. Sorry forgot to tell you earlier. 
can someone bring tennis balls btw? seems like we'll have at least a few games going at the same time
I'll bring a bunch of balls, they may or may not be a little old though
we can also play doubles if it ends up being a big group
<@U1KT5F4SZ>: Way to come in clutch! Dueces,
<@U1KRZT11T>: you should be in a teen summer movie with that talk
I was just trying to figure a way to fit in a tennis pun
<@U1KRZT11T>: i guess that says enough about me that i didn't get that 'clutch' was a tennis term. whoops...
<@U1KR9BP0E>: Its not don't  worry. I just wanted to say 'dueces' which is related to  tennis, but I figured I should say something before that. I now realize the errors in my ways and will make sure not to make that mistake again
Not my best work
I'll bring some balls as well
I am not able to go to tennis today :( but definitely next time I will join you guys
Hey, are the tennis courts at Carmichael? 
I'm going to be slightly Late! Just leaving home now. Yep courts at Carmichael.
