Anyone have a Samsung computer? I left mine at home and was hoping I could split one with someone for the day :-) :-)
You should ask Brandon for a laptop for today, maybe?
Great job today on presentations orange team!!!
Ok friends---  As you heard earlier this week, we are collecting school supplies to donate to Centennial Campus Magnet Middle School.  Kimberly G., Sharon W. and I are helping to coordinate things and we thought it would be fun to turn it into a competition BLUE vs. ORANGE cohorts. We're going to place a box in each classroom for you to put items in.  One item= one point.  The cohort with the most points wins!  We need the supplies dropped off in the boxes no later than Thursday, July 28th. Winner gets bragging rights... LET THE GAMES BEGIN!:dancer:
Hey guys - I just moved seats and I was wondering if anyone  grabbed a footrest and decided you don't need it? Let me know if you're  willing to part with it! otherwise I'll talk to Laura :slightly_smiling_face:
got one! Thanks <@U1L3K1AKD>
There is a footrest at the back left seat that is not occupied if anyone else needs a footrest.

Thanks <@U1NUU2U9E> for posting this.  We had a nice discussion about it this afternoon and it was quite helpful.
<@U1L6YQUSU> no problem! I posted the link to the documentation in <#C1KR6TMD3> 
I saw that later as well <@U1NUU2U9E>.
Would anyone in the back row be interested in switching seats?  I'm in the 3rd row.
