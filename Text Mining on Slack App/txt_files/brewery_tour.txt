Please log in and pay by Saturday 8/20/16 at noon.  We have 19 people going so far and there's actually room for 10-12 more, so talk it up if there's people who might be on the fence.
Here's the itinerary:  1 to 2pm – Meet at Clouds Brewing (eat lunch together cost not included in the tour) and have samples

2:30 to 3:30 – Neuse River

3:45 to 4:45 – Nickelpoint

5pm – Drop off
The Drop off will be back at Clouds at 5:00.
There's parking at Clouds, but you might not be in shape to drive home, so consider taking an Uber or finding a friend to be your DD.
Let me know if you have any questions.  Looking forward to it!

Thanks, <@U1L5GU954> and <@U1MBURU4D> .  7 down,
Don't forget to pay up by noon tomorrow if you can, folks!  I won't go into 'badger' mode until Monday.
I made the payment!
Bought!   Better late than never.
Thanks <@U1KS4UE2F>!
Indeed, <@U1L7E8GSU>.  
Paid! Only slightly late...
You're good, <@U1KRTHAQZ>.  Thanks$
Just a reminder to bring your ID on Saturday!  I'll post another reminder/info at some point on Friday.  Also, I'll be posting a message in the general forum that we have about 10-12 spaces available if your friends/family/other MSA folks want to go.  Thought I'd tell you folks first since you're already going to be there so you can have first crack at the tickets.  I'll be letting others know Thursday afternoon.  Looking forward to it!
Here we go.  Info for Saturday coming a few lines at a time.
Plan to meet at Clouds Brewing (126 N West St, Raleigh, NC 27603) around 12:30 on Saturday.  That should give us time to get in, get seated and settled and order food.  Samples start at 1:00pm.
Remember lunch is on your own.  We'll pay and get out of there around 2:00 and head to the next spot.
The tour ends around 4:00 back at Clouds.  Remember to carpool, Uber or get rides so that if you have too much beer along the way, you can get home safely.
And don't forget your ID.  Let me know if you have any questions.  Looking forward to it!
does anyone want to uber to the place with me ~12pm?
Don't forget your IDs today!!!!
Also I'm running a little behind.  Should be there by 12:45.  I think someone from the tour should be there already by 12:30.
I'm here. They're still getting set up
Running a little late too but on my way!
