Hey guys! I had a lot of fun at Carmen's Cafe last night. There is another event this Friday at Latin Quarters in Raleigh. Its called aPasionada Bachata night. They have a lesson starting at 8:30pm &amp; the dancing goes until 1:30. Let me know if anyone wants to join :slightly_smiling_face:
Lisa let's plan for bachata or salsa next week
Yes!
I agree
Yes!
I'm in too!
Okay!!! I'm loving this excitement :grin::dancer::skin-tone-3: would you guys want to do Friday or Saturday??
I would be down too! I'm available for either night! 
Friday :) 
I am available either day too!
This Saturday is Mojito night at Latin Quarters. It's a Salsa/Bachata night. I am not sure if they do a class before. On August 25th, they are having Salsa night at Irregardless cafe with a short lesson at the beginning and I definitely want to go to that! Would anyone want to go to either?
Both sound great to me! 
Okay! I can drive us Saturday night!
I def want to take a lesson before but I do it so I am def down for irregardless. Mohitos are my favorite drink so I would go if I don't make a fool of myself
I prefer the mojito night I like more bachata
But I would go to either one!
<@U1KRZT11T> you'll look great out there!
I am trusting you, I will go
<@U1KQTJ6BV>: I like bachata better too, I think they have that at irregardless as well, I think its a mix. They do bachata night at latin quarters some night, we could do that as well.
<@U1KRZT11T>: We could have a mini lesson at the institute before?:dancer:
<@U1KQ9523D>: perfect!
I want to take a lesson :) so would love to join you guys on August 25th
I'd love to join as well! 
I'm in
I'm super excited for tonight! Is starts at 10:00pm and if we get there around that time it probably won't be too busy so a great time to learn basic steps. The dress code is "dressy". It costs $10, but they usually do student discounts at these things, I couldn't find info on that online though. I would suggest not wearing open toed shoes as I once had another person rip off a toenail from stepping on my foot and spinning... (sorry for the graphics). Let me know who needs a ride/wants to carpool . :dancer:
I would be down to carpool
Whats the name of the place?
Latin Quarters. It's a restaurant/ bar
I'd like to car pool as well 
Ok Thanks! I would like to carpool too if that's possible 
I can drive anyone who is near the institute 
<@U1KRZT11T>: do you think Patricia and I can ride with you?
<@U1KRZT11T>: if I could ride with you guys that would be great as well if you have room! 
I live about 30 min from the institute so I can scoop people from northern Raleigh area since Tommy has the institute covered :) 
Hey so what are people wearing ??!
<@U1KSYP1M5>: I think I'm gonna wear a salmon colored cotton dress
I'm not sure how 'dressy' to go with it...
I could wear more of a cocktail dress if that's seems more appropriate? what do you guys think?
<@U1L914KNJ>: a dress is fine! <@U1KSYP1M5>:  I'm wearing a romper. :grin::dancer::skin-tone-3:
Okay perfect thank ya <@U1L914KNJ> and <@U1KQ9523D> ! By the way, the salmon colored dress sounds fine! 
The stuff I wear for business casual good enough or a little dressier?
<@U1KRZT11T>:  that's perfect! I've seen people try to come in workout clothes because it's such a good workout... I think they're just trying to avoid that by saying dress "dressy" I think even jeans and a polo or something like that is fine! 
I had so much fun with you guys on Saturday!! This Thursday is Salsa/Bachata/Merengue at Irregardless Cafe. The lesson starts at 9 pm and there is a 5 dollar cover.  At 9:45 the dancing starts! Let me know who is interested :slightly_smiling_face:
:raising_hand::skin-tone-4:
Hey guys, I actually can't go to irregardless tonight. I hope those who are still going have a great time!  I've never been there, so let me know how it is!!
I am planning to go. Let me know if any one wants to join.
