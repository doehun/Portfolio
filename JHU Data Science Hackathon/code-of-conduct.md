## JHU DaSH 2015 Code of Conduct

All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at JHU DaSH 2015 are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We are expecting cooperation from all participants to help ensuring a safe environment for everybody.

## The Quick Version

JHU DaSH 2015 is dedicated to providing a harassment-free conference experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, or religion (or lack thereof). We do not tolerate harassment of JHU DaSH 2015 participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any conference venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. JHU DaSH 2015 participants violating these rules may be sanctioned or expelled from the hackathon without a refund at the discretion of the JHU DaSH 2015 organisers.

## The Less Quick Version

Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.

Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.


If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the JHU DaSH 2015 organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the conference with no refund.

If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of JHU DaSH 2015 organizing committee immediately. JHU DaSH 2015 organizing committee members are Sean, Jeff, Roger, Brian and Leah. 

JHU DaSH 2015 organizing committee members will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of JHU DaSH 2015. We value your attendance.

We expect participants to follow these rules at conference and tutorial venue and conference-related social events (e.g. welcome reception and conference dinner).
