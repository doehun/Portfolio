# Text Mining on Slack

This is a personal project I worked on to analyze Slack messages passed between 119 classmates of our [Master of Analytics Class of 2017](http://analytics.ncsu.edu/?page_id=243). I've crawled public messages, anonymized the messages, and did some interesting analysis on behavior of our text messages. 

Read through the notebooks Part 1 - Part 4 for analysis! The rest of the folders are supporting work - code, data, and images I've used for the notebook. 

I've had a lot of fun doing this. I hope you enjoy reading my work too.
