I would assume the larger your dataset the more processing power your particular server has (not sure if that's how John set it up so you should check with him to make sure). But I think as long as your team is coding efficiently and aren't trying to run multiple highly intensive queries/algorithms at the same time you should get decent performance.

Your E:\ drive will slow down considerably if more than one person is hammering it with tasks (e.g. running R or SAS code heavily).  In such a concurrent-team-member-use situation you may benefit from keeping your data on the D:\ drive when it's actively being used (and archiving it on the E:\ drive when it's being stored for later).      However if your E:\ drive is ~8TB in size, then the performance of the E:\ drive (HDD Data) is actually at least as good as the D:\ drive (SSD Data) in all cases, and I recommend using the E:\ exclusively.       In case you're wondering why there are 2 drives at all, I configure the SAS Temporary Files to utilize the solid state drive (SSD) for performance reasons, and utilize standard mechanical hard disk drives (HDD) for their larger size.  Also if we set up a database engine for you (e.g. MySQL) I will put it on the D:\ drive for performance reasons also.",,,0,0

If you're consistently reading in the entire dataset, then the database won't help much, but it won't hurt performance either.  It's a good learning experience either way, but a team has to manage how steep the total learning curve is for everyone.  for your specific practicum, I would imagine a database would be worthwhile to utilize for speeding up queries, but not essential.

Kimberly G., Sharon W. and I are helping to coordinate things and we thought it would be fun to turn it into a competition BLUE vs. ORANGE cohorts. We're going to place a box in each classroom for you to put items in.  One item= one point.  The cohort with the most points wins!  We need the supplies dropped off in the boxes no later than Thursday, July 28th. Winner gets bragging rights... LET THE GAMES BEGIN!:dancer:",,,0,0

Hi guys, it’s almost camping time! Lots of good stuff in here so please read :slightly_smiling_face:
 
Transportation:
Drive to Briar Bottom Campground Saturday morning. Carpool list and planning are in the google spreadsheet. Depart Raleigh between 6AM (Full Hike) and 7AM (Half Hike) from the Institute. That will give us enough time to drive over (~4 hours) and get ready for the hike.

Hiking Mt Mitchell:
We will have two different hikes to the peak of Mt. Mitchell. Option 1 is the full hike starting from the campground up to the peak (~6 hours, 11 miles total) and will be led by <@U1L5GU954>. Option 2 will drive halfway up, and then hike to top section (~3 hours, 4 miles total) and be led by <@U1KRB11QC>. Be sure to bring food, water, good shoes, and a jacket! It would be best to carpool with people doing the same hike. We will be back at the campsite by 6pm. If you do not want to hike, there are other activities around the campsite that you can organize with others individually.
 
Camping:
We will be camping Saturday night in tents and sleeping bags (or in your car if you want). Please indicate on the spreadsheet if you have a sleeping bag, tent, and how many people can fit. David and I have reserved several tents and sleeping bags for those who do not have any. We may be able to get more if necessary. The campsite has toilets and quarter operated showers.

Campground:
Group Site: Red Oak
Address: 50 Black Mountain Campground Road, Burnsville, NC 28714. 
Reservation Number: 2-36653927

Basic supplies everyone needs to bring
Food
Water bottle
Jackets, hat, gloves
Flashlight
Toiletries 

Food and Booze:
You will be provided with some beer and a burger/hotdog as part of your costs to attend this camping trip. Any additional food should be purchased by you beforehand. We would also greatly appreciate anyone that brings additional booze for the group. 
 
Costs:
Cost will be $15 per person, not including transportation. Make sure you cut a deal with your driver. Please pay David Jordan on Venmo (Username: ImDavidJordan) or via cash by Friday at noon. 
 
Spreadsheet:
This has multiple tabs so please check it all out. Put your name down if you intend to go, and indicate if you have a tent plan, sleeping bag, and ride. Those who are driving and have tents, please fill it out accordingly.

Get stoked! :slightly_smiling_face: This is going to be an EPIC weekend.",,,0,0

If you haven’t signed up to camp, you still have time! :slightly_smiling_face:

Rides: Departing from the IAA (Alliance deck) at 6 or 7 depending on the hike.

The hikes: Be sure to bring warm layers, a rain/wind jacket, and a backpack with food and water. Both hikes will meet at the summit of Mt. Mitchell together for group pictures and fun. If you decide not to hike (<@U1LMHQY9E>) try to meet us at the summit where there is a parking area around 3 PM.

Food: David and I will provide burgers/hotdogs and a few sides for dinner. You will want to bring food for the hikes, afternoon snacking, and breakfast. You should also plan to BYOB if you want.

Camping: We will be outside. In the mountains. PLEASE bring warm clothes and jackets! It is better to have too many layers than not enough. Don’t forget about gloves, hats, and scarves. You may also want to bring an extra blanket for warmth at night. David and I are actively trying to ensure everyone has sleeping bags, but you may have to rent them at Recreation Outdoors on Main Campus for $8 for the weekend. We will let you know by noon tomorrow.

Payment: Remember to pay $15 via Venmo to ImDavidJordan by Friday at noon. You can also pay David via cash.",,,0,0

camping,2016-10-14 11:36:42.000030,U1KRB11QC,"Friday Camping Update:

Parking Update: Plan to meet at WolfRidge instead of at the IAA because parking is bountiful for those leaving their cars overnight. (1910 Entrepreneur Dr. --&gt;See Map:<https://drive.google.com/open?id=1ZblGeb6rbFoEP2SgEc9SeJwS2Oc&amp;usp=sharing>)

Carpools: Both groups will now be meeting up at 6:00 AM. This will make things simpler logistically in case someone gets lost along the way. 

General Packing List: Backpack, Snacks for the hike + breakfast Saturday, Water bottles (we will be at a higher elevation which will cause you to consume twice your average amount of water), Layers of clothing of all sorts, Extra shoes, External batteries for your phones, Flashlights.

Weather Update: At Mt. Mitchell, the weather over the last 3 days has been a high of 55 around mid-day and a low of 44 at night. Make sure you have what you need in order to be comfortable. 

Payment: See James or David if you have not paid yet. 

Here’s our numbers if you need anything!

Since the question asks us to calculate gains in MISCLASSIFICATION RATE, we use the formula: classification error = 1 - Maximum of (p(i|t))

Therefore, the classification error (which is our measure of impurity in this case) can not be greater than 50% (so 45/80 would be out of the question). In the case of classification error, having a 50% chance is as impure as it can get.

general,2016-07-11 19:17:34.000037,U1KQ9523D,"Hey guys! I spent some time working for a dermatologist and because it’s getting hotter and sunnier outside I figured I would go ahead and drop some skincare knowledge on you guys. Since most of the sun damage that sets you up for skin cancer later on in life happens before the age of 30, this is the time (for most of us) to be taking great care of our skin. The risk of getting a melanoma is 1/50 and rising in America (not taking family history, race, etc into account).
Everyone should be using a good sunblock when they are in the sun. Physical barriers such as lotions containing zinc oxide and titanium dioxide with and SPF of at least 30 is the most effective. I’m not a huge fan of sunscreen sprays as the FDA has not tested what happens when you inhale this product. (Therefore, you should never use this on children/babies who do not yet understand the concept of holding their breath.)
Everyone should be checking their skin once a month. This allows you to get really familiar with what your skin looks like. The ABCD’s of melanoma are great to know but in general everything on you should look like everything on you… If you have something which looks like an outlier and you cannot find anything else like it on your body, then you should probably consult a dermatologist.
There are two known causes of an increased risk of melanoma: genetics (family history) and blistering sunburns before the age of 30. Tanning beds are also correlated with an increased risk. If you have a reddish hue to your hair or blue eyes this is a sign your body is not that great at making pigment and therefore your risk of sun burning is increased.  If your skin is naturally blessed with the ability to make pigment, then the most common place for a melanoma to occur is on the soles of the feet or palms of the hands. If your skin isn’t naturally great, then any crack or crevice is fair game.
And on a side note, the risk of breast cancer in women is 1/8, which statistically speaking is quite a few of us. Therefore, we should be taking the proper preventative measures for this as well.

A few updates have been made to the MSA site for students! <https://sites.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/msa-2017/home>

Here is a run down:
- Due Dates Calendar: Has been updated, and now we have 2 people cross-checking to make sure that the dates are accurate. You can add the calendar to your view by clicking the ""Google Calendar"" on the bottom of the calendar. See Amir (in Blue) or Sindhu (in Orange) if you have any questions.

- Moodle Shortcuts: Having a hard time navigating Moodle for the latest courses? We have created a page that collects the links in one place.}

- Python: We would like to introduce Kosta Blank to our team. He created a complete page dedicated to Python.

- Google Analytics: Caroline Collins has enabled Google Analytics support, so we can make sure that we are getting the page views we expect. We will share this with you as the program progresses.

- Coming soon.. Mike Hruska has shared some quick reference material for Linear Algebra. Be on the lookout for this - I will announce it once it becomes available.

If you have any suggestions, feel free to reach out to Raj Daswani. 

Thank you,

The 18th annual Triangle Run/Walk for Autism is on October 8th!  Proceeds from the Triangle Run/Walk for Autism will fund local programs of the Autism Society of North Carolina (ASNC), the leading statewide resource organization serving the over 65,000 people in NC across the spectrum throughout their lifespans. Everyone knows someone affected by autism- as many as 1 in 59 children may be diagnosed with autism in North Carolina. 

You can make a difference in the lives of children with autism and their families by registering for the Triangle Run/Walk for Autism. I've created a team to honor my little brother Alvaro and his love for ketchup. The race is on October 8th and registration is $30.00 which includes a t-shirt. You can sign up for the 5k competitive, 5k noncompetitive, or the 1 mile competitive or non competitive run/walk. I will be running the 5k noncompetitive but you're welcome to sign up for whichever race or donate. Please join us and make a difference in the life of someone you care about with ASD!

I couldn't remember the percentage (maybe 20%?) of code related questions, but I do remember that the questions I struggled the most are code related. I usually don't memorize SAS options and instead, I try to memorize what we can do in SAS and when I have to use a certain procedure or option, I use the help documentation. This doesn't work for SAS certification. So I would recommend to try to remember the most often used procedures and related options correctly. For example, in the model statement of proc logistic, to specify the category of response variable we want to model , which option can we use, (event=1) or (event=""1"")? The similarities and differences between proc glm and proc ttest? Which procedure can be used to impute missing values?  How to code a series of dummy variables by using array?  Options( I forgot which option) in Proc glmselect.  Options used to output certain estimates, specificity and sensitivity?  That is all I can remember.   However, every individual exam may be different, so don't rely on this questions too much. :grinning:",[u'clap'],[9],9,1

POTS is the most common disease you've probably never heard of. Standing for Postural Orthostatic Tachycardia Syndrome, POTS is an invisible illness affecting all of the ""automatic"" functions of the body (i.e. heart rate, blood pressure, temperature). 

My sister Paige was diagnosed with POTS in 2011 - after a year of countless doctors appointments in search for an answer. It's a debilitating disease that completely changed her life and many others. She went from a normal college student to someone who couldn't stand long enough to brush her teeth. 

She's one of the very lucky patients in which her symptoms have improved over time. She is so fortunate for her health, but there are millions of people suffering from this currently incurable disease. Men and women are in wheelchairs, have feeding tubes, and are unable to work because of this illness. 

Donating to Dysautonomia International will get us closer to a cure for POTS! A small donation would be greatly appreciated, as further research will impact millions. Thank you :)

Thank you! And please forward on the link to family / friends.

Update on the babe (besides being the best): GREAT suck reflex, he gobbled down his first bottle. He can be held - not skin to skin because of IVs. He is alert and has good muscle tone! He is pooping! (I never thought I'd be excited about that)! Clinically, for now he looks great. The concerning: the neurologist confirmed that he has HIE - mild to moderate brain trauma in his frontal cortex. The doctor says there is a risk for developmental issues but cannot put a number on what the probability is. Cerebral palsy ruled out for now. It's possible there are no developmental issues, and there is a potential that there is. Time will tell. Regardless of the potential issues, he is prefect and amazing and such a blessing to us already. My wife has been a total champ and is recovering well. We are still processing all of this but are grateful for the progress he has made. Thanks all for your love and support. I saw that many of you signed up for the meal train.

At times, the opinions of the panelists seemed disjointed but one thing was clear. _Sexism is lurking in social norms and undermining our progress towards equality, and also preventing a lot of really talented women from participating and contributing to their full potential._ A few people are content with the status quo but as one of many who is not, here are my goals:

1.    Speak up, politely calling attention to any potentially discriminatory or exclusive behavior
2.    Not feel shame or guilt if someone calls me out for having an implicit bias
3.    Keep an awareness of my privilege
4.    Include female and gender-neutral pronouns in hypotheticals

If anyone feels like they're being blamed for things they didn't do, consider shifting your focus to what you can do.

I’ll admit that I have a long way to go. Women disproportionately assuming the note-taker role wasn’t on my radar before Thursday. Subconsciously, it felt natural. I’m thankful it was brought to my attention and I'll be mindful going forward.","[u'clap', u'+1', u'raised_hands']","[22, 9, 9]",40,3

My church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, has been taking calls from anyone affected and organizing ""rescue"" clean up efforts for them. This week, a group of us and those of other faiths in this area who would like to help will be driving about an hour south to chop tree branches, knock out dry wall, and remove debris from people's homes. We will leave about 7am and be back at about 5pm. Let me know if you would be available to come....we have some volunteers but we need as many muscles as we can get!

As long as you're making an attempt to be insightful. The questions on the Wiki page ( <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junto_(club)> ) are a good guideline.

2. What did you mean by ""results"" when it says ""Use your results from the previous RFP to simulate drilling costs""....should we sample from our 10,000 simulated values from HW1 or should we sample from our kernel distribution itself?

3. Are we simulating values for a single dry well &amp; NPV of a single wet well starting in 2017 and (if it is a wet well) going for 15 years in the future?",,,0,0

Yes, it does mean that the residuals have mean 0, but that will usually always be the case when linear regression is run. I think in this problem, Dr. Labarr is talking also about the linearity in the residual plot so can this be captured with a linear model. If it is not, you could have the problem of a misspecified model, so you might have to add higher order terms. For example, if the residual plots appear to have a quadratic shape, then you would want to square one or more of your predictor variables in order to capture the true relationship between your x variables and y.

An automatic data conversion is performed whenever a numeric variable is used where
SAS expects a character value. The numeric variable is written with the BEST12. format
and the resulting character value is right-aligned when the conversion occurs. In this
example, the value of Phonenumber is converted to character and right-aligned before the
SUBSTR function is performed. Since there are only 10 digits in the value of
Phonenumber, the right-aligned value begins with two blanks. Therefore the SUBSTR
function picks up two blanks and a 3, and uses the BEST12. format to assign that value to
Code. Then, the parentheses are concatenated before and after the two blanks and a 3.","[u'+1::skin-tone-5', u'neutral_face']","[3, 1]",4,2

If anyone wants a study break on July 27th, the Durham Bulls is partnering with Book Harvest. Bring a new or gently used children's book to donate to Book Harvest and receive free admission to the game.

From the Facebook event:

Book Harvest is a Durham-based nonprofit organization with a simple mission: making sure every child in the Triangle and beyond is growing up in a home filled with books! Did you know that book ownership is the number one predictor of academic success for children? Sadly, 67% of American children growing up in poverty own no books at all. Help us change the literacy landscape by donating a book--and get in free for the game at the same time! Everybody wins (and we hope the Bulls win, too)!

Anyone is welcome to come, with family or without, but it is definitely geared towards 0-10 year olds. There is a hay ride, mazes, animals, farm equipment etc for $14... 1 free pumpkin for every ticket bought. For $22 there are train rides and gem mining and other things.

As we roll into Fall 2, a few of us--who so dearly love the Halloween season--thought it might be good to put a couple fun events on the calendar as motivation. So in that spirit, <@U1KRBFY3Z>  and I (with many thanks to co-conspirators <@U1L415ECD>  and <@U1M1L5G6L> ) would like to announce HOWLAWEEKEND. Two parties. One weekend. A monster mash of good times. 

On Friday, Oct. 28th Sylvie will be hosting a party at 401 Oberlin Road (feat. Rooftop Deck, Jack O'Lantern Cooler, and Beer Pong). On Saturday, Oct 29th, my brother and I will be hosting a party at 5435 Silver Moon Lane (feat. Keg, Luke the Yellow Lab, and Fog Machine Dancing). Costumes are highly encouraged.

You might be asking yourself: Hold up, two parties back-to-back? Isn’t that crazy? Might that involve too much fun? Well the answers to those questions are, respectively, yep, yep and nope. That’s what HOWLAWEEKEND is all about, so get ready.

Example 1: We are interested in studying how early chimpanzees get out of bed in the morning. We go to to the rain forest every morning and record what time a family of chimpanzees get down from their trees. So we like to sleep in and we get there every morning at 9:00am sharp to record what time each of these monkey get down from the tree. Some mornings, there are already a few monkeys down from their trees. We know that these handful of early-rising chimpanzees at the very latest (upper limit) woke up at 9:00am, but we don't have any kind of lower limit for them (they could have gotten up at 5:00am!). Those chimpanzees are left-censored. We pack up to leave everyday to go home at 12:00pm. There are still monkeys up there sleeping in the tree! These monkeys are right-censored...they have a lower limit (they MUST have woken up LATER than 12:00pm) but we don't have any kind of upper limit on them (they could have slept there all day)","[u'monkey', u'see_no_evil', u'angel']","[15, 1, 1]",17,3
