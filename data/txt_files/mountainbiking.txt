<!channel>: when does everyone want to do this thing?
I'm down for any time after this weekend
I also down to bike whenever! This weekend is goof for me, but I know Kelvin doesn't have his bike yet, so maybe next week some time?
I won't have my bike back for a couple weeks so I'm out until then. I'll let you know when I get it back though 
I plan on going mountain biking at around 5 or 6pm on Friday at Crabtree if anyone would like to come
