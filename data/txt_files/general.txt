<@U1KQYG6SJ|rose> set the channel topic: For class-related/logistics discussions and announcements. Everyone is in this channel
Welcome everyone!
thanks for setting this up, Rose!
sure thing
I'm still configuring some things/ checking out integrations
if anyone wants anything, let me know! (I believe we have a limited number for a free version of slack)
I've got giphy and lunchbox in there right now
What a great idea, Rose!
:blush:
:+1::skin-tone-4: thanks for setting this up Rose! I feel super clued into things now :slightly_smiling_face:
As an early adopter :wink:
Btw, for anyone on this group. I just found out that we have access to free fitness classes at Carmichael Gym! Also, parking is free there after 5:00 pm. You have to sign up for an account at <http://IMleagues.com|IMleagues.com> and use that website to sign up for individual classes under "group fitness", more information provided here: <https://recreation.dasa.ncsu.edu/fitness/group-fitness/>
Thanks Rose.
Thanks for making this!
awesome! love the idea
Hey! We are thinking of getting a group to go downtown on Saturday would anyone be interested? 
I'm down for that
I'd join as well. Anyone interested in getting a pickup soccer game going at some point on Sunday?
On Saturday would anyone be down to play, a round of disc golf, ultimate Frisbee, or go on a run?
I'll play some disc golf, there's a good course on Kaplan. 
id be in for that I live right down there
I'm in for heading DT, I also live about 3 blocks away
I am in for meeting up downtown, might I suggest the Raleigh Times as a meeting place or did you have another place in mind <@U1L46HXCJ>?
I am in as well. 
I might be in for downtown! Have some tentative plans with family but definitely keep me in the loop. Also if everyone texts their numbers I'm happy to start making a contact list of phone numbers!
my number is 404 988 9650
Unless a contact list already exists somewhere?
I don't think a contact list exists yet.  That's a great idea.
Downtown and sports sound good to me. 
Downtown sounds great! I'm in.
I'm in for DT also. Raleigh Times sounds good to me.
I'd be down for possibly something downtown tomorrow night!
I'm in for DT as well!
Me too!
Same for me also! I need to clear out a few neurons for new ideas from our professors :-)
I'm down for downtown! What time should we go?
Yes! Let me know details!
I'm heading to Caribou coffee (3300 Duraleigh Rd) for a few hours to do stats and SAS. If anyone needs either caffeine or motivation to study, come and join me!
Also if you're into to art or looking to spruce up your new digs, there is an art block party pop up sale at the Raleigh Makert. 209 Bickett Blvd
Raleigh, NC 27608, USA. It's going on noon till 4 today. 
If you're interested in disc golf we'll be play at 1:00 at 4531 Kaplan Dr, Raleigh, NC 27606. 
So for everyone who wants to go DT tonight... how does meeting up at Raleigh Times around 8pm work?
It works for me!
Works for me too
I'm in.
 Sounds good to me 
For anyone trying to go DT a little later (and drink a few before) a group of us are meeting at my house to take ubers to Raleigh Times. 2616 Scattered Oak Ct, all are welcome anytime after 8! 
If anyone heads to glenwood south let me know because that's where I'll be! :slightly_smiling_face:
For soccer tomorrow--would morning or evening be better? Location: Miller Fields (unless someone has a better spot in mind). I'll bring a ball.
Sounds good to me. See y'all at the bar around 8 
If anyone without a car needs a ride to Raleigh Times, let me know! 
I wouldn't mind driving to Raleigh and carpooling to RT
If anyone wants/needs a designated driver let me know 
<@U1KT3UELS> I'd like a ride if the offer still stands. I live just about a 4 minute drive from our building, on Gorman Street
Happy to give you a ride, <@U1KQYG6SJ> ! I'll shoot you a direct message so you can send me your address. 
If anyone needs a ride from the Wakefield/Wakeforest area, let me know. See ya'll tonight.
Currently at beer garden! May make my way to Raleigh Times later this evening. Just an update if anyone is headed out now!

Hi! I know this is off topic, but does anyone know a good streaming website to watch the final match of copa América?
Hello yourself
So sad I missed out on last night.  I hope I can make it next time!
Basketball at 6:30pm tonight at The U courts, all are welcome. 
I'm in. Where's the U?
I figure those are just courts 9-11 at Carmichael.  I'll be there.
I'm going to Carmen's Cuban Cafe tomorrow night for salsa/bachata/merengue. They do a lesson from 7-9 and then have  social salsa dancing from 9 on out.  The lesson  is $10 with a student ID &amp; afterwards it's $5. If anyone wants to join, let me know :dancer:
Here's the address for The U: 3333 Melrose Club Blvd, Raleigh, NC 27603
<@U1KQ9523D>: I think <@U1KQGRG2F> and I might come! I hope you don't have to be good at dancing though :see_no_evil:
<@U1L9DD1NY>: Yaay! I'm excited :slightly_smiling_face:
Does anyone play indoor volleyball? 
<@U1KQ9523D>: I will be there as well
I play volleyball!
<@U1KRZT11T>: <@U1L9DD1NY>: This  will be my first time going to this particular one so I hope its fun :slightly_smiling_face:
Who's up for an Escape room?
Let's all do one on Friday!! After class because we get out early?! <@U1L6YQUSU> 
What's an Escape room <@U1L6YQUSU> ?... sounds creepy.
An Escape room is where they lock you in a room for an hour and you have to solve a series of puzzles to get out 
Sweet! Let's go!
<@U1L6YQUSU>: I'm down for an escape the room outing! 
I'm down too.  Let's do Friday!
<@U1L6YQUSU> I'm definitely interested!
me too!
Not friday1
!!!  People will be out of town!
:point_up_2: outlier alert
^ Agreed
I've created an Escape room thread for those interested
Click on the top left pound key sign and you'll find this and other threads 
Anyone from Raleigh have any recommendations on where to watch fireworks this weekend?
Koka Booth always does something and (in my memory) it's free. That's where I used to go!
I think downtown Raleigh by the Red Hat Amphitheater has a fireworks display around 9:30!
There is also fireworks at Brier creek that are decent.
Here is an option in downtown: <http://www.raleighconvention.com/works/>
Hey guys! I created a Latin Dance thread to post about upcoming events :dancer:
Just created a recreation channel for all outdoors activities. 
Hey all, this is the link Brandon sent me to get the printer set up: <https://sites.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/iaa-it-support/iaa-student-printing>
^ also make sure you are connected to the internet through your ncsu login and not through another school otherwise it won't work
Hey guys-- is there anyone who lives near/drives past the Raleigh Greyhound station (2210 Capital Blvd, Raleigh, NC 27604) after class? Was wondering if I could hitch a ride on Friday after class- I have a bus out of Raleigh at 1.30 and was hoping not to leave my car there for the entire weekend. Let me know if you are willing and able!
Hey y’all! For anyone who’s new to the area or anyone who just wants to see all there is to do in Raleigh, there’s this great website called Offline that always posts different lists of events going on and other places to go see in the area! They have a wide variety of stuff on the site (it’s also an app!) so feel free to check it out! It was created by NC State grads which is pretty cool! :slightly_smiling_face: Here’s the link: <https://www.get-offline.com/discover>
<@U1KR9BP0E>: I'll be driving past there and would be happy to drop you off if you haven't found a ride yet
<@U1KRWUXFU>: I would really appreciate that. Thanks so much Julia. :slightly_smiling_face: You OK with leaving right after class ends aroudn 12 or 12.15?
<@U1KR9BP0E>: yup! That's when I was planning on leaving!
<@U1LBRCSEA>: this is exactly what i need in my life. THANK YOU!
<@U1KR9BP0E>: no problem, enjoy! :slightly_smiling_face:
anybody play instruments and want to jam a bit this year?
I'm going to start a "tree fell on my house" channel. Anyone else joining?
Oh no!! Did anyone get hurt?
Everyone aok. Kids aren't too thrilled about it. :-\
Ohmygosh, that’s so awful! Glad everyone is safe though!!
Eek! Glad you are all ok! 
For those of you who will  be around this weekend, I plan on hiking the 5.8 mile Company Mill Trail at Umstead State Park on Sunday afternoon.  Anyone is welcome to join. It should be pretty cool.
<http://www.ncparks.gov/william-b-umstead-state-park/trails>
<@U1L7RPG1M>: I'm definitely interested. I live right next to umstead... Love hiking/biking there.
I was thinking about going to Umpstead sometime too!
<@U1L7RPG1M>: I'm down!!!
<@U1KQ9523D> seems pretty excited about hiking. lol
<@U1L7RPG1M>: haha for sure! What time should  we plan on starting the hike?
I checked the weather forecast again and it now appears Sunday is no good; scattered thunderstorms all day. But Saturday morning/afternoon looks all clear. Will that work for everyone?
Yeah that works for me!
Same here!
Same here too!! 
Ugh I don't think I can do sat:crying_cat_face: unless we do it in morning?!???
Let's get there at 10 am. And I can fit three others in my car for anyone who'd like to carpool.
What entrance should we meet at tomorrow? I live near the PNC arena so I could give rides, or I could ride with somebody if we want to carpool
<@U1L46HXCJ>: can you do 10? If not I could do earlier  :slightly_smiling_face: !
<@U1KQ9523D>: yes that works for me!!! <@U1L7RPG1M>: if you live near aventferry/tryon/trail wood that would be awesome!!
I'll pick you up <@U1L46HXCJ> ! :smiley:
<@U1L2P17DZ> That's not too far. I can pick you up, too. That leaves one open spot in my car.
That would be great! Thanks! My number is <tel:919-426-5810|919-426-5810> and I live at The Parke at Trinity (used to be Trinity Park)
No problem! And the last spot has been claimed by <@U1L7ERY77>.
I'd love to come too! 
What entrance are we meeting at? 
You should come! We're meeting at the Reedy Creek Entrance at 10 am.
Let me know next time ya'll want to go  hiking! I'm out of town this weekend, but would love to join another weekend! :cry:
Yea ditto. I can't make it tomorrow but next time I would love to
<@U1L41DF9D> and <@U1KRZT11T>  I'll keep you in the loop. Next time! :blush:
I'm in agreement with <@U1L41DF9D> and <@U1KRZT11T>   I'll make sure to be available next time!
<@U1L7RPG1M> I can't make it tomorrow either but would love to go on future hikes with everyone!
Seems I'm slacking on keeping up with Slack, but I'd love to join the hike tomorrow! Let me know if anyone needs a ride! 
would love to join the hike as well! <@U1KT3UELS>: would be great to get a ride if you have space!
So happy to give you a ride, <@U1KRBJP47> ! I also have one spot left in my car if anyone else needs one!
<@U1KT3UELS>: I'd love a ride too!
Last seat is yours, <@U1LJRDPLP> ! 
thanks so much <@U1KT3UELS>!
<@U1L7RPG1M>: I'll be there tomorrow too :-)  If anyone is coming from near RDU, I'm happy to offer a ride.
Congrats to all Escape room teams.  The MSA program went 3-for-3 with escapes today.  A good time was had by all.  I'll post the group picture here as soon as they post it.  
Hey all, Nimish Sneha and I will also meet u for hiking. If anyone would like to come and needs a ride let me know i have 2 seats open :spock-hand: unless i decide you live too far away :eyes:
Ahhh Emmy's emoticon wins :-)
<@U1L6YQUSU>: Send some of the group's expertise my way.  I'm attempting to escape from the airport but Southwest keeps defeating me!!
<@U1L93SMGF>: try asking for one of your 3 hints 
I'm down for hiking as well, see y'all at 10
Does anyone think it's too wet to go? I just opened my window, and realized it rained last night (I live in the Cary area).
<@U1KSL7L7R>: I was thinking the same thing, I'll go if everybody else is going, but it's supposed to rain off and on today and there's a chance of storms.. 
I'm still down to go, but it depends on everyone else. I'm hoping the storms won't really start until later. 
<https://www.wunderground.com/cgi-bin/findweather/getForecast?query=27513+-+Cary%2C+NC>
<@U1KSL7L7R>: don't be a baby 
Hahaha that's hilarious
Anyone brining bug spray? I can trade you some sunscreen...? :partly_sunny_rain:
I have bug spray!!
You're a life saver <@U1L2P17DZ> !!
I've already had 2 knee surgeries so I gotta be extra cautious with these old man knees, y'all have fun! I'm gonna bow out and listen to music, eat cereal, and do SAS
Lots of people out hiking/running/biking here...
 Almost there !
We are running a little late due to <@U1L7RPG1M> 's diarrhea! We will be there soon :hankey:
And y'all are perfectly safe <@U1L1D4WG7> ! I just got terrible knees is all
We're running a little late too but almost there!
W r here
We are here too. 
Reedy creek entrance? Off Harrison avenue
I didn't realize I didn't have notifications on, I'll be there next time we do an umstead trip 
I'm so bad at this stuff!!! I need to set up notifications too. Have fun on the hike :slightly_smiling_face:
Ok I just got the slack app to get over my fomo. Now I'll be connected! 
Oh yeah, the fomo is very real. 
That's us studying SAS at our 1800's era desk
Hahaha <@U1L1D4WG7> I love that. Very real. Hope you fixed your roof! Glad no one was hurt.
<@U1KR9BP0E>: The roof will take a few weeks to fix I think. The tree is gone though, so now I don't have 2000 lbs of pine tree balancing over my bedroom. :slightly_smiling_face:

Hey Guys from Raleigh please suggest if Bodie islands is worth going? 
Any help would be appreciated. Thanks in advance :)
<@U1KRNH021>: the bodie island lighthouse is really cool to climb, and it's on the outer banks which has lots to do! There's jockeys ridge (huge sand dunes), the wright brothers memorial (where the first flight was achieved) and such. They're only about 20 minutes apart if you want to explore bodie island and those things
<@U1KRNH021> second that nags head is great! Definitely need to see the outer banks of you're living in NC. If you go I would recommend checking out kitty hawk which is where the wright brothers memorial is
Thanks a lot for your inputs.
Outer banks is really pretty! 
Any kind souls willing to pick me up at the Raleigh Amtrak tomorrow (Monday night) at 9 pm and take me to my apartment  by PNC arena? Will be rewarded with redeemable karma from me in the future (like, I'll get you lunch from the food trucks one day! Also you <@U1KRWUXFU>!)
I can give you a lift.
<@U1M4QJD4P>: thank you so much!!! really appreciate it. i'll message you separately.
Just got an email about this new Meetup group. First event on employee attrition modeling is scheduled for 7/26: <http://www.meetup.com/Raleigh-Analytics-Meetup/>
Hey all - Since there are many "sources of information", I have created the following Google site as your one stop shop... <https://sites.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/msa-2017/>
Please let me know if you have any issues accessing the site. And feel free to make any suggestions - and volunteer if you want to help keeping this up to date. Thanks!
Wow, thanks Raj!!
Wow that's awesome !! <@U1L0V1X61> 
Thanks, Raj!
<@U1L0V1X61>: I don’t mind helping keep things updated.
Thanks, John!
Dunno ‘bout ya’ll but that little whiff of our first project got me super excited.
<@U1M4QJD4P>: Big time!
/giphy excited
Does anyone know how to access the e-learning for programming 2?
I think this should be it: <https://support.sas.com/edu/OLTRN/ECPRG293/index.htm>
I can only see programming 1 there...
I just learned this today go to Moodle-&gt; 500-&gt; self- paced elearning-&gt; 2nd link-&gt; type in the code onto the right hand side
Can you see both?
This is what I see - are you not seeing the same?
She didn't use the code before so she can only see the free ones, I know from experience 
you're right <@U1KRZT11T>, thanks!!
Would anyone who got the first week of communications training and second SAS certification exam be willing to switch with me?
Is there a way to access the e- learning programming 2 ? I did not use the activation code earlier :(
Just using the activation code should open up access to everything we'll be learning in this program
This is what I see.
Hmm.. Try going to <http://support.sas.com/edu/viewmyelearn.html|support.sas.com/edu/viewmyelearn.html> there should be a box to activate a new product, if you enter the code there it will open everything
<@U1LMHQY9E>:  I helped <@U1KRNH021> solve that problem - she's good to go!
Just wanted to throw it out there to everyone that just got a new NCSU email for coming back to school, that we should qualify for a free six month trial of Amazon Prime Student!
Just as Emily said :+1: 
<@U1L6WB44A>: Thanks! Not only that - annual cost is cheaper as well ($49 / year instead of the regular $99 / year)

Is anyone interested in going to Jasmine Mediterranean tomorrow for lunch?
SAS Certification, Stats Exam, Summer Practicum... It's a lot of work, but DJ Khaled believes in you
<https://youtu.be/K23_vkcsncA>
<@U1KSYP1M5> wish I could come! I was there last week, and their baba ghannouj is AWESOME
<@U1KSYP1M5>: what is that! Tell me more! 
Hey, I have the wife and kids visiting this weekend. Does anyone familiar with the area know of some family-friendly activities around Raleigh? Parks, places to walk around, museums, etc.?
<@U1M37FW5U>: Pullen Park is right by campus and it has a mini train for kids, a merry go round, paddle boats, and playgrounds. There's also the North Carolina Museum of Natural Sciences which is in downtown Raleigh and pretty cool for adults and kids! I went there a lot growing up :blush:
The North Carolina Art Museum also has a cool outdoor walking path with neat sculptures and grassy areas for kids to run around in
There's a science museum in durham I used to LOVE going to as a kid.  I think they reworked it fairly recently and it's gotten better, from what I hear.
<@U1M37FW5U>:  The Museum of Life and Science in Durham that Rachel mentioned is fantastic. And Raleigh has the Marbles Kids Museum. My sister takes the kids she babysits to both of those on a weekly basis and they love it. The Durham Bulls games are also fun to go to if you're looking for an evening activity. 
<@U1KSYP1M5>: I'm down!
If anyone is hitting up club hunt tonight let me know! :nerd_face::books:
<@U1L2P17DZ>: <@U1L7E8GSU> <@U1KT5F4SZ> Those all sound awesome. Thanks for the suggestions! 
There are donuts upstairs in the orange classroom if anyone wants one (this includes blue folks who are willing to make the trip)
<@U1M37FW5U>: check out this site as well - they have all kinds of events
<https://www.get-offline.com/discover>
Okay sorry I think we are gonna have to postpone for the jasmine restaurant, it's kinda hectic right now with all the summer project meetings but let's plan to reschedule for next week! 
<@U1KR9BP0E>: sorry I'm just seeing this but jasmine is a Mediterranean restaurant, haven't been but apparently it's supposed to be really good! 
<@U1L46HXCJ>: don't come to hunt! It closes @ 6! I just got thrown out!
Just added the Hunt Library hours to the MSA 2017 site for your reference :slightly_smiling_face:  <https://sites.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/msa-2017/>
<@U1L7ERY77>: Max, were you slacking from the back of a patrol car?  The Hunt library security guy just came through the graduate student lounge and said that yesterday a student refused to leave at 6 and had to be brought "downtown" so he would appreciate it if we would leave before 6. :open_mouth:
He just says that to scare people 
#MaxNeedsBailMoney
Hey, would anyone be willing to switch Communication training days with me? I currently am assigned to Aug. 8-10 and it would be great if I could go Aug. 1-3. As a thank you, I will take whoever offers out to a dinner of your choice (within reason, financially haha)
How I feel after most days of class <https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=PQkGn9AI8ms>
Hey guys! I spent some time working for a dermatologist and because it’s getting hotter and sunnier outside I figured I would go ahead and drop some skincare knowledge on you guys. Since most of the sun damage that sets you up for skin cancer later on in life happens before the age of 30, this is the time (for most of us) to be taking great care of our skin. The risk of getting a melanoma is 1/50 and rising in America (not taking family history, race, etc into account).
Everyone should be using a good sunblock when they are in the sun. Physical barriers such as lotions containing zinc oxide and titanium dioxide with and SPF of at least 30 is the most effective. I’m not a huge fan of sunscreen sprays as the FDA has not tested what happens when you inhale this product. (Therefore, you should never use this on children/babies who do not yet understand the concept of holding their breath.)
Everyone should be checking their skin once a month. This allows you to get really familiar with what your skin looks like. The ABCD’s of melanoma are great to know but in general everything on you should look like everything on you… If you have something which looks like an outlier and you cannot find anything else like it on your body, then you should probably consult a dermatologist.
There are two known causes of an increased risk of melanoma: genetics (family history) and blistering sunburns before the age of 30. Tanning beds are also correlated with an increased risk. If you have a reddish hue to your hair or blue eyes this is a sign your body is not that great at making pigment and therefore your risk of sun burning is increased.  If your skin is naturally blessed with the ability to make pigment, then the most common place for a melanoma to occur is on the soles of the feet or palms of the hands. If your skin isn’t naturally great, then any crack or crevice is fair game.
And on a side note, the risk of breast cancer in women is 1/8, which statistically speaking is quite a few of us. Therefore, we should be taking the proper preventative measures for this as well.
Cheers!
That ended up a lot longer than I thought it would be :joy:
wait so i have to put sunscreen on the PALMS of my hands?

Is anyone by chance still in the building? I think I may have left my laptop charger at my desk in the back row of the orange classroom. Anyone willing to help me check? 
I can check 
Thanks <@U1L6YQUSU>! 
No charger at your space back here 
<@U1L6YQUSU>: oh man where did I put it... thanks for checking. 
Does anyone have Adobe Acrobat or adobe illustrator on their computer? In preparation for the Stats tests on Monday, I noticed the practice assessments Labarr gave us access to don't have answer keys. So I was wondering if someone could make a google doc real quick so we could work on them together and make sure all answers are correct. I tried to do it, but I don't have Adobe stuff, so none of the formatting or charts/graphs/tables would copy over. 
<@U1KRMNVGC>: I like that idea but I am not sure I have the software either
Hey Conner Cross &amp; Tommy I uploaded the assessments on the google drive.
Perfect. Thank you so much. 
The folder is assessable only with the ncsu email id.
hey yall so we are trying to work on the programming practice test and there is no bottle data set in the sasuser library or sashelp or bootcamp or anyhting. we cant find the data. has anyone done this yet
I asked Dr. L about it and he's not going to upload those data sets. He said use the ones we used in class. 
Hey everyone.  If you changed cohorts, don't forget to change/add the appropriate other color channel here in Slack so you can keep up with your new group.
How do you do that? #slackingontechnology
<@U1LMHQY9E>:  To leave a channel you can type /leave and then you can add the new channel from the menu on the left
You have to press the plus sign next to "channels" to get a list.  Gotta join them all!
Hey guys, I am currently in communications 2 and certification 1. Would anyone be willing to switch the communications week with me so I can travel the next week? If you do, drinks are on me. 
I am in communications 2 as well . If anyone else would like to switch so I could travel during that week just let me know. Thanks
Are we also supposed to dress business casual tomorrow for the alumni thing?
It's optional <@U1L3G0YRJ> 
Thanks!
<@U1L3G0YRJ>:  according to google calander "Alumni talk about the program, their experiences and answer new student questions.  ATTIRE is casual unless you just want to wear something more formal."
Does anyone have good notes on stats,  that wouldn't mind sharing them? My notetaking ability is pitiful :sweat_smile:
does anyone have a list of all the in-class exercises we did for stats -- across all the chapters?
I am also looking for someone in communications 1 to switch with me (I'm in week 2 communications!)  Let me know if anyone is interested- free meal on me!
If anyone wants to know the exercises, Dr. LaBarr sent them to me: Here they are - 
1-40
1-48
2-33
2-44
2-63
2-80
3-25
3-41
4-18 (use PROC REG and its options here, not the ones listed)
4-46
5-17
5-47
6-14 (use the methods discussed in lecture to partition instead of PROC GLMSELECT)
6-20 (score using the techniques in lecture instead)
7-33
7-56
7-68
I brought in the Harris Teeter instant coffee for everyone, it's fair game for anyone who wants some
If anyone left a black North Face jacket in the auditorium it's now up behind Jessica's Desk.
<@U1L6YQUSU>: that's mine, thanks for taking care of that!!!
for anyone who's interested in group classes at Carmichael, you can check out the gymclasses channel for discussions about classes/finding buddies!
A group of us is in the grad lab in Hunt studying if anyone wants to join!
If anyone wants to run;;;;;; through the coding section of the exam, I'll be in the grad lab at 2 today
Has anyone in the Raleigh area lost internet for the last couple hours?
Just did now, unfortunately :-(
Does anyone want to meet for a review study group tomorrow? I typically only like to study by myself, but I think bouncing ideas and questions off eachother could be beneficial. 
<@U1KRMNVGC>: I would definitely be interested in joining the study group tomorrow, so just let me know! 
<@U1KRMNVGC>: If you post it, they will come.
POWER OUTAGE??? Come onnnn!
can you do effects coding for anything that's not three levels?
I feel like all the examples I've come across assign -1, 0, 1 -- are other combinations possible?
<@U1KQYG6SJ> yes, you just add an additional design variable 
<@U1KQYG6SJ>: I'm pretty sure effects coding works for any number of levels. Whichever level is the "reference" will have -1 as the value 
<@U1KQYG6SJ> you justalways have 1 less design variable than the number of levels you are coding, so 5 levels would be: 
                           1000
                           0100
                           0010
                           0001
                           0000 (or -1-1-1-1)
oooh
I think I've been thinking about this in a really weird way
thanks!
matrix form totally clears everything up for me
Me, too -- have to see it to believe it, hah
my confusion was because I was thinking I needed to control the rows, not the columns, and it was confusing the heck out of me
I don't know where I got that idea :joy:
I'm gonna head to the library about 1:30 if anyone wants to join for a study group. 
If anyone is using notepad++ and wants to format the code to SAS, this link might be useful

Is there a file of answers to the material practice exam? Sorry if this has already been asked recently haha
<@U1MDE4NAG>: Sneha Komma sent out an e-mail to the google group with her answers in a google drive: <https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0BwP7cAy4bkJBb2FVekFuS2FZVXM&amp;usp=sharing_eid&amp;ts=578588a9>
Thanks!
In our class example when we did a chi-square test between lot_shape &amp; bonus we got an odds ratio of 0.1347. So is the interpretation then "A house is 7.42 times more likely to be bonus eligible if it has an irregular lot shape, with respect to odds"? Just wanna confirm if this is correct.
I think you should just say "7.42 times the odds," not 7.42 times more likely, since 'more likely' seems to me to refer to a probability.  As for the rest, I don't have the problem in front of me.
I think you can say it either way. "7.42 times more likely" is the media way of saying it, but it's not technically wrong. Think of it like this: The odds of rolling a die and getting a 4 is 1:5. It's 5 times more likely that you'll roll something other than a 4.
For the p-value explanation in the effects and reference coding questions, do you guys think saying "a significant different exists" is enough or should out explanations reference the actual p-values?
Dr. LaBarr confirmed that it is acceptable to say more likely, though you are more specific if you use odds in your explanation
Gotcha thanks everyone
I think for the p-value explanation, he is looking for the right explanation. Like for effects coding... The variable is significantly different than the mean of all of the variables. 
Does that make sense <@U1MDE4NAG> ? 
I figured that's what he was wanting, I thought the phrasing was weird though
There was a similar question to #28 in the primer in regards to interpreting the coefficient of a binary variable.  We evaluated it using both effects and reference coding, I would evaluate it in both ways unless the problem explicitly says how the variable was coded.
<@U1MDE4NAG>: also be sure to evaluate differently depending on if it is logistic regression or not.  Interpret the p-values in terms of the logit for logistic regression but simply in terms of the variables for multiple regression.
Happy birthday <@U1KRHCR7T> ! :birthday:
Question on Computing Assessment, question 2c. It wants us to include Gender in the regression, but proc reg has no class statement to allow for categorical variables (right?). However, Gender is already coded in 1s and 0s.  Does that mean it's fine to use in the proc reg model statement as is? 
<@U1L6WB44A>: Yes that's correct. Since gender is already coded you can use it in the proc reg model statement without any issues.
On number 3 part b of the computing assessment they ask "Is an exact test needed for this data set"? Does anyone know what they're looking for here?
<@U1KRTHAQZ>: So the cross tabulation table indicates that some of the expected values (we used Ameshousing3 comparing heating quality to bonus) are very different than the actual values so we would like to use an exact test to better understand what is happening.
At least that is what i think they are looking for
<@U1KRTHAQZ>: I think they're asking whether you need to test with pearson's chi-squared or mantel-haenszel. That's why the following sentence says "explain and report the appropriate chi-square..."
Oh okay that makes sense. Thanks guys
<@U1KRTHAQZ>: I just watched this lecture &amp; he also said that if we have a large sample size &gt;50 we could consider either Chi-square or Likelihood Chi-square (they should be very similar), but if we have a small sample size we use Likelihood chi square :slightly_smiling_face:
will anyone be online later tonight ~8 that can compare code with me?
<@U1KQ9523D>: Thanks Lisa! I wasn't quite sure about that either. 
<@U1KT9ATA5>: I'll be on around then to compare code
<@U1KRTHAQZ>: ok cool!
<@U1KT9ATA5>: which data set are you going to be using?
<@U1L40P4N9>: i guess ameshousing
Regarding the odds ratio question <@U1KRTHAQZ> asked, is it also correct to say that "the odds of getting a bonus are 87% less if the house is regular shaped"?
Maybe I should add "than if it is irregular shaped"
<@U1L3K1AKD>: I think you're correct in saying that. 
Thank you <@U1KRTHAQZ> 
Is anyone studying at the library now or planning in being there later?
I'm going to get there around 8. Probably will stay until it closes. 
Well I am going to probably be there too then cause I could probably study with someone if you don't mind
Of course! The more the merrier. 
Where are you going to be at in the library?
I'm thinking the grad lounge on the 4th floor. 
Cool we could snag a study room... I will go ahead a reserve one
4302!
Awesome! Thanks for doing that! 
First one is right If they cross the diagonal they are not significantly different
The first one. Diffograms are not appropriate visualizations for interpreting confidence intervals
They are your CIs and the diag is like your "no difference threshold" if it crosses not significant. That's how I think of it at least
I also understood them as <@U1LHLK8MR> explained. The lines represent CIs, which will be the same length if each group has the same number of obs, if the CI crosses the diagonal it's not significant
Yes, This is correct. However, use a diffogram only to see if there is a significant difference between the means and not to compare confidence intervals. The y-axis is vertical, but the confidence intervals have a 45 degree incline which visually can throw you off.
Does anyone know how the reference interpretation works with effects coding if there is more than one categorical variable included in the model? Is the reference the average of all carvel rival variables (or levels)? Or is it the average of all levels for that variable?
Carvel rival=categorical 
It is the average of all the levels for that variable
Thank you!!! 
FYI for anyone who doesn't have a calculator for tomorrow you can rent them from Hunt for four hours at a time (can renew it once online to have it for up to 8 hours)  
<@U1KRLV1CG>: thanks!
Did anyone use ameshousing3 and want to compare codes
And thanks for the diffogram answers!!
Enjoy your good luck Munchkins and rock your tests!!
I created a Facebook group that anyone can join <https://www.facebook.com/groups/1603148159998309/>
Just to confirm, Computing Assessment starts at 1? 
yes
Got really paranoid there for a second that I was missing it :sweat_smile: 
Banana republic is having a great sale! 60% off on top of the sale price! Just in case anyone is in need of more business clothes! :raising_hand::skin-tone-2:
Hey, my car got rear-ended yesterday (on the way to get a calculator for today's test). Does anyone know of a good bodyshop in the area?
On the subject of clothes, I have a gift card to J Crew that has $72 on it. I went there over the weekend and couldn't find much in my size. Anyone want it for $55?
<@U1KRHCR7T>: I would do that... I could venmo you money or give you cash tomorrow
<@U1Q7LP4V9>: sweet! I don't have it on me right now but should be able to bring it tomorrow
For anyone who is bowling we're planning on getting there around 4:30 so people who need to get socks and snacks have a chance to do that :bowling:
<@U1M37FW5U>: caliber collision, I've had some work done there before.  
For anyone at the IAA - is there  a set of keys in locker 15 downstairs?
<@U1KRBJP47>: I have them!
Great job everyone! We made it through our first exam :grinning::grinning::grinning::grinning:
<@U1KT5F4SZ>: thank you thank you! Clearly I'm not all with it after that exam...
There's a red NC State camelbak left in the lunch room on the table, I put it in the fridge on the right 
So... I'm pretty sure I left my laptop in the classroom after the test this afternoon. Did anyone see it by chance? 
hey all, for anyone struggling to sync specific calendars like MSA Orange Team or MSA Blue Team to their iphone, this link should fix that: <https://calendar.google.com/calendar/iphoneselect>
Does anyone want two tickets for the Dierks Bentley concert this Friday? I bought a 4-pack and 2 of my friends can't go. Let me know!
Does anybody know when we will find out about how we did on the assessments?
I asked Dr. LaBarr, and he said Friday
Also when we get the Myers-Briggs results :slightly_smiling_face:
awesome!! Thanks, <@U1L0V1X61>!
a day of self-discovery!
Did anyone see a pair of black wireless headphones around the institute today? Perhaps in the kitchen? Or fridge? :grimacing:
I think there might have been a pair beside the fridge!
<@U1KQYG6SJ>: they are definitely by the fridge 
Phew, thanks!
Anyone who changers to an NC Drivers license go to the avent ferry DMV? 
Changed*
From out of state, I mean
I'm not sure if that DMV is still operational
I've never seen it open
It is! It stays super busy. That's where I went (the one on avent ferry and gorman)
Try going early in the morning (as soon as it opens which I think is 8 am) and it will be faster. But it might still take like 2 hrs 
Yea I went to the avent ferry location a few months ago.
I had to go back twice though - they needed a lot more documentation than was made clear on the website
Ok thanks guys. I was in line and a guy told me they didn't do out of state license changes, so I got Super nervous and thought I should go elsewhere. But it was all good and I was out of there in an hour. I showed up at 7:30 though and was #4 in line, which I advise for anyone else going there. 
I had to take a written exam to get my nc drivers license a few years ago... Idk if that's still the case but you should look into it

If you really enjoyed Dr. Healey's presentation the other day you might like this ~60m presentation from Xan Gregg  JMP Director of Research and Development at SAS.  There is some overlap from what Dr. Healey said, but  covers it in a slightly different way and uses great examples. <https://community.jmp.com/docs/DOC-8270>
Shoutout to Dr. healey on WRAL news tonight talking about plagiarism!
Is Melania Trump the subject of the talk?
Hey there.  I'm cleaning my office and found a TI-89 and two TI-83+ calculators that I'm going to put on eBay.  I thought I'd see if anyone wants/needs one here first for cheap.  Message me if you do.  
Hi guys, as everyone starts making presentations, just wanted to remind everyone to be mindful of color selections since Dr. LaBarr, I think, might be in some of our presentations so don't forget that he is color blind. Check this out to see how colors would look to him ( I think he would be considered a deuteranope on some of these pictures from what I read online).

Hey folks.  There's a blog post on the student blog on our Escape Room outing.  <https://datacolumn.wordpress.ncsu.edu/2016/07/05/escape-room/>
Hey, did anyone get the exam grades? I thought we were getting them today...
Hey if anybody is looking for a desk for their house/apt/tent/current living quarters I have one I had to get rid of strictly because I don't have any room for it. It's about 2'x4' on the surface, gotta get rid of it soon. Free OBO
Me please <@U1LMHQY9E>

Hey does anybody know how to convert the p value to show other than &lt;.0001? 
You can output the p-values into a new data set and view the real values. I don't know if you can change it in the output report though
I think if you output the results to a dataset it gives exact detail.
Right. What <@U1L415ECD> said :-)
Gotcha, thanks guys
whoa, how do you output p-values into a new dataset?
Hey! Is anyone at the library?
I think I might have left my mouse in one of the rooms at the graduate lounge
If you have a problem with normality due to skewness and transforming your variable with the natural log doesn't work to fix it... What do you do next?
Try using a non parametric method maybe? Those don't require a normal distribution... But it depends on what you are trying to do
I believe you could try other transformations to try to fix normality. For instance you could try sqrt(y), 1/y, 1/y^2, 1/sqrt(y). You could also use nonparametric methods like Cecilia said because they aren't based on the any parametric model. 
But a problem with the other transformations is it can makes it much harder to explain 
As we all work to finish our projects and presentations, there is a light at the end of the tunnel!
<@U1KRBFY3Z> and I have organized a little get-together for everyone after our presentations on Wednesday. We have reserved the entire back patio at Mellow Mushroom from 5-7pm, just for our program. We can all hangout, eat, drink, and celebrate the completion of Summer II. 
So finish strong. And see you at MM.
Does anyone know how to resolve this error in SAS? "The SAS system stopped processing this step because of insufficient memory." Help! :see_no_evil: 
Try a library computer with SAS?  Can't guarantee it fixes that error though.
This forum says something about a memsize=max option <https://communities.sas.com/t5/General-SAS-Programming/SAS-insufficient-memory-error/td-p/180723>
I read that post too, but it says it's only enabled at startup? I'm not sure what that means?
Ok friends---  As you heard earlier this week, we are collecting school supplies to donate to Centennial Campus Magnet Middle School.  Kimberly G., Sharon W. and I are helping to coordinate things and we thought it would be fun to turn it into a competition BLUE vs. ORANGE cohorts. We're going to place a box in each classroom for you to put items in.  One item= one point.  The cohort with the most points wins!  We need the supplies dropped off in the boxes no later than Thursday, July 28th. Winner gets bragging rights... LET THE GAMES BEGIN!:dancer::skin-tone-3:
<@U1MDE4NAG>: I've had that error come up before. If you clear your log and delete some of the files in the work folder that you don't need anymore sometimes that gets rid of that. It can just be because SAS has too much it's trying to remember during that session 
Does it make sense to say "166% more likely" when interpreting odds ratios? 
<@U1L9DD1NY>: if I heard "more likely" in that way I'd think the odds were 2.66 to 1.  If that's the case I think it makes sense.
That is the case! Thanks <@U1L974M70> 
Is anyone here on the student health insurance? I noticed we are automaticlaly charged for it unless we submit a waiver. Can anyone walk me through what I have to do if I want to be on the student health insurance plan -- what paperwork will I need to complete? Their website has thoroughly confused me...
Also when does coverage actually kick in? I'm off my current insurance as of August 1st so I need to make sure I'm covered afterwards...
Coverage starts sept 12
I'm in the kitchen area if you want to talk about it
<@U1KR9BP0E>: I went to StudentBlue office ok friday, I can tell you what they told me
You can also call them and get them to add you early, I got added in the beginning of June because I lost my insurance from work at the end of May.  I just had to pay a little extra
<@U1L7E8GSU> and <@U1L3K1AKD> ok awesome thank you. They say to only call for billing and payment questions... I might go in person. <@U1L3K1AKD> did you just go to the student health center to ask about it?
No, I was having too much trouble and they wouldn't let me enroll for the summer session, So I had to go there
I'm in the kitchen right now if you want to come
<@U1KR9BP0E>: 
<@U1L3K1AKD> and <@U1L6YQUSU> I'm still at home... I plan on getting there around 2. I'm still waiting on finding out more information, will reach out to both of you once I know for sure whether I need student health insurance or not. Thanks!
<tel:1(888)351-8283|1 (888) 351-8283>
This is their their phone number... 
Thank you!
I suggest you call them, but they might not be very helpful
I'll be in our group meeting at 2, but you can text me questions 
I enrolled and my insurance coverage is from August 1 
Yep, I called and they said it was August 1st. Thanks guys!
Someone also left a page of their presentation notes in the Roanoke classroom
Does anyone have any insight in to parking at the airport? Is it generally easy/economical to find a spot or are you better off taking a taxi/uber to get there? 
(Specifically RDU)
For how many days, <@U1L6WB44A>?
4 days! 
It's easy to find spots.  There are satellite lots with shuttles that are cheaper than the main garage.  You might be better off bribing a fellow student with a beer or sandwich
It's $12 a day in the daily lot I think.
Thanks, John! 
<@U1L6WB44A>: there are also park and ride lots right beside the airport with free shuttles. I think these are $6 or $7 a day. 
<@U1L6WB44A>: I've used fast park and relax for over a decade. Lots of shuttles, covered parking, pick you up right at your car, and cheaper than airport park and rides.

groups that present tomorrow morning - dont forget that we start at 8:30! :smile:
Business formal! 
that's optional....... just kidding!
Don't forget, Mellow Mushroom at 5 everyone!! Especially those who finished up this morning!
Is the mellow mushroom in raleigh or Cary?
Glenwood 
I suppose a location might help...

Here is an interesting article on how each MBTI type deals with stress <http://psychologyjunkie.com/2015/08/02/how-each-mbti-type-reacts-to-stress-and-how-to-help/>
Anyone who's already SAS base certified want to study for the advanced exam together? Let me know! 
Anybody know what the answer to question 43 on the material exam was?  Was it 0.643?  Still don't quite get odds ratios.
<@U1KRNTXL5>: Yeah it was 0.643. You do 150/250= 1.5 which are the odds of No in group A and then 175/250=2.333 which are the odds of No in group B and then 1.5/2.333 = 0.643 is the odds ratio between No in A and B :slightly_smiling_face:
Gotcha, thanks
Would anyone be down for a day trip to Carowinds on Aug 11th?  :roller_coaster:
Hey everyone! Now that we are done with the Summer semester and you might have a bit more free time (for now), i wanted to see who would be interested in studying Python. I have heard that quite a few of us would want to do that so I made a little website with some basic instructions how to get Python and will be posting some small projects - check it out: <https://sites.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/learning-python-for-data-science/>     
There is also a slack channel <#C1WNCHYSC> for those of you who would want to ask questions and discuss projects/code... i don't know much Python, but would like to learn and maybe even assemble a team and try to tackle a project from <http://Kaggle.com|Kaggle.com> which would be very interesting... please feel free to share your feedback with me! have a great weekend everyone. :smile:
Snakes.  Why'd it have to be snakes?
Does slackbot send auto messages every time Python is mentioned?
Snakes.  Why'd it have to be snakes?
Python.
Snakes.  Why'd it have to be snakes?
Snakes 
No, you have to say Python. 
Snakes.  Why'd it have to be snakes?
Hey y'all I hope you are having a good weekend! I move into my new apartment tomorrow and I was wondering If anyone is around and willing to let me borrow their muscles! I'm moving in right after communications training tomorrow 5:00-5:30. If anyone would be down text me 9192806193. Food/beer will be rewarded for sure! 
Is there any specific attire to wear to communications training?
Check your email for something from Sarah regarding dress
Now go finishing watching Bourne, <@U1LMHQY9E> 
Business casual for monday and tuesday and business formal for wednesday <@U1LMHQY9E> 
Where are we today? On the calendar it still reads "detailed schedule with locations to be announced"
I assumed the auditorium since we weren't all in the same cohort but I could be wrong. 
A couple people asked for my address. Im planning on5:30. Thanks guys you rock! 
Hey James came and we got it all but thanks for everyone who offered to come out 
For those that are in the communication training:
I got half way through my power point for the presentation tomorrow and I realized I may have misunderstood her. Does she mean present on a visualization tool? (Bar chart, pie chart, map). Or does she mean pick a visualization that has already been created and present on that? (A map of deaths in US in 2013)
The latter, I think
I'm assuming it's the latter since she said something like an infographic would be alright.
Haha dammit. I was afraid of that 
has anyone else had issues uploading files to Moodle in Chrome? Not sure if it's one of my plugins/extensions that's causing it
Anyone want to grab chipotle for lunch?
Did you already go?
Ya. sorry phil 
Mine won't upload either did you figure it out <@U1KQYG6SJ> 
Ended up using IE <@U1L9DD1NY> 
Hey all, does anyone know a good place where I could go run stairs? :runner:
Someone left an HP wireless mouse in the Polk conference room. I have it in my locker, so I can give it to you tomorrow - just let me know
You're a good man, <@U1KSR1MS4> 
FYI - you don't have to wear your suit and tie all day if you're in Comm 1.  You can leave off the tie &amp; jacket this morning while you're working.
thanks Laura!
Does anyone know for those reading assignments  that Dr. West gave us do we have to have just the first reading assignment done by the 22nd (project management body of knowledge) or do we need all of the reading assignments done?
You just have to do the first one. I'll update Moodle.
<@U1XCJ1X4H>: Thank you! 
People who have comms training this week, is there hw for the evenings? Trying to figure out how much time I have for review after the trainings next week.
*hw = homework, in case that wasn't clear
There is homework each night that will take a big chunk out of your evenings. 
Thanks <@U1KRB11QC>! I'll try and get most of it done this week then.
For those of us still reflecting on team experiences, here's a really in-depth article from NY Times about what makes for good teams (and bad teams). I'm still making my way through it, but it hits on a lot of the things we've learned from the MBTI team exercises, and the debrief with Dr. West. <http://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html?_r=0>
The TLDR is: Google had this long-term project to find out what makes for a successful team, and none of the data was able to identify patterns on success - basically teams that hung out outside of work were just as likely to be successful as teams that didn't, teams full of introverts were no less likely than teams without introverts, etc. The MOST important identifier was actually something harder to spot -- team norms. Whatever these norms may be (preference for strong leadership as a team, or a cutlure that "encourages vigorous argument and spurns groupthink", when a team comes together, these norms supercede individual proclivities in determining the effectiveness of a group.
Whether they are written or unwritten norms. I definitely observed this in my own practicum team experience, and I wonder if others feel similarly.
Great article.  From what I can read it sounds like teams that naturally 'agree' on roles and expectations do better than other teams.  That would make sense.
Also the last part of the article kind of reminds of this piece I read a while back.  There's probably something to be said for being in a team culture where people feel safe to share their thoughts.  <http://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2016/06/17/482203447/invisibilia-how-learning-to-be-vulnerable-can-make-life-safer>
 Hey just a heads up. Starting today my state id is inactive until the 9th when fall starts. I'm not sure if it's like that for everyone. But if you are trying to go to the gym and your card is inactive just go to the help desk and explain and they will give you a day pass!! :grimacing:
So that's what's going on! Thanks for the heads up! :slightly_smiling_face: <@U1L46HXCJ>
Good luck to everyone taking the certification tomorrow! Hope you all walk in there feeling bold, confident, beautiful and most importantly...SASsy!!
Anyone know what time people are playing ball tomorrow morning, if at all?
<@U1KR80QMS>: don't think there's basketball tomorrow morning. We played today at 12:30 as per Brandon's email 
<@U1KR80QMS>: you need to get on the <#C1RD90DQU|hoops> channel!
<@U1MDE4NAG>: you are right! How do I do that??
Touch the hashtag in the upper left, then click the plus sign next to "channels" 
<@U1KR80QMS>: 
Anyone else just lose power :(
<http://outagemap.duke-energy.com/ncsc/m.html>
I thought you all might appreciate this.  I wonder if Dr. Healy would enjoy the hexagon map and the snake-like projection.  <http://projects.fivethirtyeight.com/2016-election-forecast/#plus>
Anyone going to comms tomorrow have an extra pair of headphones? Could have sworn I had a pair but it has mysteriously disappeared...
<@U1KR9BP0E>: I have some!
Earbuds
<@U1KRNHQA1>: thank you!!! 
Are the self-paced exercises on moodle?
Yea that's what she said! 
Has anyone else in communications training noticed that the submissions window for our 5 minute presentation on Moodle closes in 45 minutes?  I'm not crazy in thinking nothing is due tonight, right?
no, definitely not due tonight, because I know we have some time in the morning to work on it. must be a mistake!
Thanks Zach, I thought that was the plan as well.
I submitted my presentation (whatever I have) but agreed with both of you that Sarah said we would have time to work on it tomorrow in class. 
If this helps at all ours weren't due until around 12:30 p.m. on the second day so you guys should definitely have time tomorrow! 
Not sure I like the name of this emoticon... <@U1L9DD1NY> was not meant for a facepunch! lol
<@U1KRLV1CG>: fist bump! 
Anyone interested in getting lunch at chick fil a in Cameron village? I've gotta swing by bank of America also 
I wish you had sent this 10 minutes ago <@U1KT9ATA5> 
:( why
Does anyone in communications training today have super glue they could bring to school? My shoe fell apart :grin:
<@U1L3G0YRJ>: I have shoe glue but I won't be in for another half hour..
<@U1LMHQY9E>: thank you I would love to borrow it! Let me know where I can meet you!
I'm in dare, stop by whenever 
Anyone seen Sarah, Etta, or Kate recently?
nope, not in her office either
I love this video, seems relevant to this morning's talk about conference calls.
<https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYu_bGbZiiQ>
<@U1L6YQUSU>: thanks! This is helpful! You guys seem to have covered some things we didn't mention last week! 
Just a reminder for people who drive to give Jessica their check for parking! (I know I almost forgot last time)
Would anyone be willing to trade one of their checks in exchange for cash for parking? I can stop by your house tomorrow morning 
<@U1L3PU7BJ>: sure, i have my checkbook with me
General info:   I'll send out new blue / orange split tomorrow.
You won't need to be in HW teams until august 22 and we'll definitely tell you HW teams before then. 
I believe practicum teams announcements are set for Aug 26 (team &amp; lead) / sponsor reveal is Sept 1.
ahhh, no..I've got an update. HW teams are needed by Wednesday August 17th, so I'll be telling you the HW teams (will post to Moodle) on Monday or Tuesday next week.
Anyone wanna grab lunch?!
Me and Ceci aré in the oval if you wanna join us <@U1L9DD1NY> 
I'm heading to Wilmington tomorrow around 7:30-8 am. If anyone was planning on going and wants to carpool let me know. :hugging_face:
I'll be heading there after the sas exam if someone wants to ride with me as well! :blush:
Are y'all day tripping or full weekend?
 Is anyone at the institute currently? I urgently need help printing something and my computer won't connect to the printer even though it's worked before
<@U1KR9BP0E>: you can print at hunt in the grad lounge if it doesn't work! 
<@U1LMHQY9E>: I'm going for the whole weekend. 
Alright pretty last minute on this, but can someone explain why jobcategory isn't overwritten here?
It is, but the length is fixed at 2, so it still looks the same.
That one made me angry that I missed it lol
<@U1L1D4WG7>: it got me too and I felt the same way! 
Got it, that's annoying, thanks guys
<@U1LAAMJ0M>: and you aren't late btw, the SAScoding channel has like 100 posts an hour right now lol
What?? How do I find this channel?
Found it, thanks
I just want everyone to know that the Perseid meteor shower is tonight, with the peak at 1am. Some estimates go up to as many as 200 meteors per hour!  If anyone needs to  make a wish on a shooting star for the SAS exam tomorrow, you have plenty of chances.:blush:
So sweet, thanks Preble boys (Ed included!)
Haha, that's awesome! Thanks!
Good luck everyone!!!  I know you'll do SAS-tastic.
This is my pre test pump up jam. You guys got this! <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ThI9yWUmOlk>
Don't be hatin' cause you're jelly 
Good luck everyone! :computer: :thinking_face: :nerd_face: 
Hey folks.  I'm trying to gauge interest in lining up a private Raleigh brewery tour for MSA students and their guests.  I need to get a count of who might be interested.  If you are, please react in some way to this post.  If you'd be bringing someone, react twice.  I'll put specifics on the group message board.  Let me know as soon as you can!  Thanks.
Today or in the future?
Looking at August 27 or sept 3
Personally August 27 works better for me but I understand if I'm outnumbered :)
OK.  I updated the post in the forum, so ignore the first one.  I talked to the guy and clarified a few things.  Also, he reminded me that Sept 3 is Labor Day weekend, so we settled on August 27th.  Read through and let me know via email if you're interested so I can get a count.  <mailto:jrbetz@ncsu.edu|jrbetz@ncsu.edu>
Anyone wants to go to the beach this weekend? April said it's probably the last chance we have this year!! We have only two people now.
The only reading Dr. West wants us to do for now is the "Project Management Body of Knowledge" one, right? And we have until Sept 22nd to do it?
August I think
August 22nd
It says september on moodle and I suspected it was a typo... 
I know Dr West's email says august 22nd, but I don't know if moodle is wrong or the email...
FYI shooting at Crabtree mall... Don't go there right now
<!channel>: 
Thx for the heads up Amir 
Hope no one gets hurt 
Nimish and I were just there. Left right before the shooting. Damn......
<@U1KRTHAQZ>: yeah i was just driving home from basketball and saw at least 20 cop cars around the entrance. I asked one of the guys standing on the sidewalk what happened 
Yeah it's crazy. The area around crabtree is usually pretty safe. One of the safer parts of Raleigh. Hope no one was injured
wow prayers to ppl who were shot and injured.. so glad pranav and nimish were safe.. crazy to think they made it out 15 minutes before it happened...
People were shot?
<@U1M37FW5U>: I don't think they confirmed if anyone was shot or injured. 
Not sure yet, they only said shots were fired 
Watching coverage.  No real information or details yet.  Don't drive near there, though.  Everything is shut down.
:flushed: I live right by there. Scary scary
Does anyone know if orientation on Monday is required for us?
<https://grad.ncsu.edu/students/orientation/> says it is <@U1MDE4NAG> 
I feel slightly obligated to encourage you all to watch Michael Phelps last race ever at ~10:04pm
He'll be back #phelps2020
Does anyone know if there's a wolf line bus that goes to where the graduate orientation is from Avent Ferry? 
<https://grad.ncsu.edu/students/orientation/> At the bottom of this page, it has an FAQ on how to get to McKimmon Center. Buses from Centenial Campus will be running from in front of the engineering building or Oval drive, depending on the session! 
I'm planning on leaving the Venture Parking deck around 8:20/8:30 for orientation if anyone needs a ride.
I can give up to 3 people a ride to the afternoon orientation.
<@U1L1D4WG7>: <@U1KQ9523D>: which lot are y'all going to park in at McKinnon?
McKimmon has visitor lots that we can use tomorrow and we can park in the Varsity lot and Varsity gravel lot.
<@U1L3K1AKD>: One option is to take the #9 wolfline to the fraternity ct stop... McKinnon is about a 10 minute walk away
I'm in the afternoon session if anyone wants to ride with me
I have room for 3
<@U1L3K1AKD> <@U1KRBJP47> I can pick y'all up!
Thanks <@U1L3G0YRJ>!
<@U1L7ERY77>: Can i come with you in the afternoon? That'd be awesome!
<@U1L7ERY77>: I'd love a ride if you still have room?
or <@U1L1D4WG7>, sorry didn't see your message
<@U1KQ9523D>:  I'll ride with you inthe morning if the offers' still on! which parking deck is the venture parking deck?
I'll be in the kitchen area at 12:45 Monday for anyone that needs a ride for the afternoon session. 2 spaces left.
<@U1L914KNJ>: yes, absolutely! They just switched me to the venture deck. I think it's the one across the street from the Institute.
great! I will meet you there in the morning :slightly_smiling_face:
<@U1KQ9523D>: Do you  still have room for one person? :slightly_smiling_face:
<@U1KRLV1CG>: yes! I can take you :)
Awesome! Thank you so much! :slightly_smiling_face: I will be at the venture parking deck at 8:20
<@U1KRLV1CG>: okay great!
<@U1L1D4WG7>: Can I also ride with you tomorrow for afternoon orientation? Thanks!
<@U1L1D4WG7>, do you have space for one more?
<@U1Q5GHC2J> and <@U1KT2JJE8> room for both! See you tomorrow.
<@U1L1D4WG7>: Thanks!
If anybody needs a ride for the afternoon session I can take 3!
<@U1L2P17DZ>: can I claim one of those spots? 
If there's any available I could use a ride <@U1L2P17DZ> !
Yea, I can take you both and have room for one more!
I'll be driving as well. If anyone needs a ride in the afternoon, I can fit 3 as well 
Is anyone from the morning orientation here at McKimmon yet?
<@U1KRMNVGC>: we're on the left side in the back 
Just parked! 
Just walked in.
How was parking? Easy?
Yeah they have people directing. 
There are no words to describe this orientation.
Lots of good tidbits.
You can get $9 worth of apples and water bottles in the back of the auditorium :smile: 
I think that is the charge for orientation
We miss you <@U1KRLV1CG> .  Did you sign in?
There is also free ice cream at the info fair :icecream:
Sorry guys, I couldn't take this any longer...
ummmm Sign in <@U1L6YQUSU> ?
What sign in?
<@U1L6YQUSU>: if my chair gets kicked one more time... 
<@U1KT9ATA5>: where are you?
Way in the back right 
Where did we have to sign in?
It was just a joke <@U1KRE1L9M>
For those who are still at the fair, the traffic to get out of the parking lot is already bad. Plan accordingly.
<@U1L7ERY77>: Nils and I are good on the ride. Thank you anyway!
Girls from the area: Any recommendations from decently priced ($50 range) and good hair salons in the area? Maybe one with a student discount??
Red salon 
I got my hair cut done there :) they did a good job. 
It is $40 but there is a Groupon coupon which has 60% discount. 
Banana Day at Goodberry's today.
Dr. Race is pregnant.  Please spread this truth for mathematical modeling purposes.
Race is pregnant!
Omg no way!
Come back to the room! We are reviewing 
Orange folks, Come back to class :-)
I need to get a final count of how many people would do the brewery tour on 8/27 to see if we have enough to make it go.

Please email me or message me if you're committing by 11:59 tonight. I need to give them a number by tomorrow.  

If you're not sure what I'm talking about, check the details in our Google groups message board or ask me.  
Anyone know if Dr. Dickey's slides from data mining are posted to Moodle or another source?  I'm about to email Laura otherwise...
They're on Moodle! Under "Data Mining: Dr. Shaina Race" in 502
Congrats everyone on reaching the 10,000 message plateau on slack!
Hi all, I just created an R channel for those who like to collaborate. 

I don't have any direct purpose for the channel other than it being a place where folks can ask questions or if they want to learn together. I'm a newbie to R, so I'll be diving into the textbook we just received. Let me know if anyone would like to work through anything together!
Hello yourself
If you guys noticed the summer semester 500 module is gone. Dr. West's readings have been moved to fall but the "overview" document (which we are supposed to read before anything else) has disappeared - here it is!
Thank you! <@U1KR9BP0E> 
Bless you <@U1KR9BP0E>! I was just looking for this today! 
Thanks to <@U1KSR4JP3> for sending it to me. I was super confused.
Does anyone know which Rapid Predictive Modeling for Business Analyst we should do to get ahead? EM 6.2 or EM 7.1?
Do both, <@U1L3PU7BJ>.  Better safe than sorry.
Seriously, though, I don't know.
Does anyone know if there is a list of everyone's email addresses for our program somewhere? (Students) I tried the NCSU campus directory and did not have any luck. Thank you!
Slack has some of the emails in the profiles of each person.
Hey all, I'm going to start working on the Google analytics certification because I think it should be possible to complete it before things get too hectic this fall. Join <#C22B70N4B> if you are interested in more info :-)
I think they're automatically in your gmail contact list and will appear in email if you start typing the person's last name <@U1SMADBU4> 
Thank you <@U1L6YQUSU> and <@U1KT3UELS>!
<@U1L6YQUSU> :broken_heart:
 Sorry I let you down.  I'd go with the later one myself.
<@U1SMADBU4>: just go into the MSA forum or like a group email sent by Laura 
And start searching, u should find them that way. If u need phone numbers, there is an excel document with that info on the MSA website created by raj 
Just a tip for everybody, you can change the way your name is displayed on Slack if you have not done it yet. Swipe left starting on the right side of the screen and click settings (I understand it doesn't work for everyone ). In settings, click edit profile and you can add your name. Then you can go back in settings-&gt;advanced and you can 
Click the display real names option which makes it much easier to see who everyone is
Thanks <@U1KRZT11T> ! for those of us who use Android phones, you need to do that from a laptop version of Slack... the phone App doesnt have that functionality :disappointed:
Ahhh, this is literally thousands of times better now
Thanks tommy! Also, another question about certifications. Does anyone have any info on preparation and scheduling for the other certification exams? I saw info on moodle but was looking to see if anyone knew info on things like whether we will be prepared for those certifications or we should start prepping for them on our own. 
We will be prepared in our classes**
I know we're doing Advanced SAS classes.  The SQL part starts next week.
Business analyst and predictive modeling will all be in September/October/November time frame. The earliest you can take business analyst I believe is September 9th and it's basically what we learned in stats 1 and the coding behind that. If you go to the sas website they will tell you how you can prepare and specific e-learnings to look at. Regarding what we cover in institute classes I'm unsure of how it aligns with prepping for certifications. The first advanced analytics one isn't until December or January I believe. I would start looking at business analyst first as we covered a good portion of the material in summer with stats 1 and the coding behind those (regression, anova, etc.). Then do predictive modeling. Then advanced. 
Most of the prepping for the specific certifications will probably be on your own, but we will still go over the topics in classes - they just won't be completely SAS certification surrounded like the programming classes were this summer. Sorry for such a long message! 
Thanks Caroline! That was helpful irregardless of length :)
(I hope I guessed your name correctly based on your id) 
Thank you John as well!
Yes, you're correct! I'll update my ID as I saw tommy just posted about that! No problem at all!! Glad I can be of help!

writing and blogging primer just disappeared from my calendar, but on the blue calendar it's still there (and says combined cohorts). Is anyone else seeing this?
I am seeing the same thing <@U1KQYG6SJ> and I got the notification that it was canceled from gcal but seems so unlikely...
annnnnd it's back
I'd be down for making a podcast.
Are there practice questions out there for the business analyst SAS certification?
Does anyone know when (or whether) we are getting the "Leading Project Teams" textbook? Dr. West's document says we should have gotten it during communications training and I want to do "three before me" before asking him about it. The quality of the PDF is terrible
Consider myself 1 of the 3 <@U1KRE1L9M>.  I have no idea.
<@U1KRE1L9M>: yes we are getting into it and I believe we have to read that by next week 
I was looking for the deadlines on each of the readings and just checked with Dr. West-he said that in the new West's reading overview document on aa 504 on moodle has the deadline for each document listed next to its name 
I'm going to message management at the radio station I used to work at and see if I could do a couple of random shows throughout the year. It'd be really fun if I had two or three students at a time to interview/talk about WHATEVA. Let me know if you'd be interested! <mailto:dmalave@ncsu.edu|dmalave@ncsu.edu>
we can download and keep the shows to put on the blog
<@U1KSBCBFG> Do you know if we're getting the hard-copy textbook though?
Not sure let me go and ask
<@U1KRE1L9M>: the books haven't arrived yet. So just skim what's possible/readable to get a general gist 
<@U1KRE1L9M>: update: a more readable pdf version will be updated soon 
<@U1KSBCBFG> <@U1KRE1L9M> Trying to create a better Leading Project Teams PDF version I realized that the current PDF displays fine OUTSIDE of a browser window ... so try downloading it and opening it with perhaps Adobe PDF reader and it looks a lot better.  Still waiting on the books to arrive USPS/UPS/FedEx..need about 22 more before Dr. West will distribute them. Hard to tell exactly when they'll arrive.
Seeing if I can find another format that does actually display well in a browser window now.
<@U1M37FW5U>  Business Analyst certification should be taken Sept. 30, Oct 5 or Oct 6 after the Logistic Regression class. I know everyone will pass it, but... the make-up date for  Bus. Analyst is Nov. 10th. Look on Moodle for practice questions. Business Analyst does not have as many readily available study materials as BASE because it is a fairly new certification (about 3 years old? maybe 4 now). You don't need to prep as hard for it as you do for BASE b/c it's much more straight forward and is what you've been studying here since Primer.  Our students typically do very well with this exam. If you want more information, you should google the test. (The business analyst exam is A00-240)
For those who have an iPhone, the Leading Project Teams shows up great on iBooks. 
New Leading Project Management versions posted (new PDF &amp; a word version). Hopefully one of those will work better for everyone.
Thanks Laura! 
I'm heading up a lunch field trip to Five Guys Grill on Tuesday 8/23.  Watch this forum for info.

Does anyone have a bike air pump that I can borrow for the weekend?
<@U1L3K1AKD> I do, I'll bring it tomorrow.
Thanks Peter!!
No problem!
<@U1XCJ1X4H> Thank you for the information!
The Brewery Tour is a go!  We have enough people initially (20) to schedule the tour and there's room for 10-12 more.  So if you find you're free or decide to come, please check the new "brewery_tour" channel for information or ask me.  We're going to have a blast and maybe we'll even blog about it.
Laura says we need the Enterprise Miner book for today! If you took it home, make sure to bring it in!
<@U1KR9BP0E>: is that the forecasting book?
It's the thinnish one that says "SAS Enterprise Miner Tour: Hands-On Workshop"
I don't have one of those, when did we get them?
It was in the pile
Like this week's pile I believe
It was in the first pile
Summer pile I think
Ohhhh summer pile. It must be in my locker. Thanks guys!
Donuts in the blue classroom if you want one, orange folks.  Sorry you have to travel now.
If you are trying to print and it doesn't work the first time connect to NCSU and try again
Anyone who lives near RDU airport? 
<@U1L3K1AKD>: do you need a ride to the airport?
its in my general direction
Another PSA: I just found out that some people don't know that there are other channels on slack. Most of the plans for doing things are located in the Social channel. There are also many others that can be joined depending on your interests. That is all :microphone::airplane_arriving:
Is that airplane music?
Tacking on <@U1KRZT11T>'s post, to find all these channels, touch the top left corner of this screen, then touch the plus sign next to the word "channels."  All our channels are there.  You can even create your own. 
<@U1KRSV7AN>: hah that is what it looks like but I couldn't find the emojis I was trying to convey my point 
Mic drop?
Yep
Any recommendations for a good place for lunch in Durham? Thanks!
<@U1MBT6FRB> says there's a really good bojangles in Durham 
Bach burger is the best I have ever had. Expect a line. If you are looking for something light (like a good sandwich) try Francesca's (excellent ice cream) or Toast on Main st. If you feel like having Pizza, Toro is an excellent wood-fired oven place. Expect a line there as well.
<@U1KRE1L9M> I'd recommend Bull City Burger or Geer Street Garden
I'm thinking of going to the Durham Bulls game tonight if anyone else wants to join
Thanks <@U1LMHQY9E> <@U1MBT6FRB>  <@U1M1L5G6L> and <@U1KRLV1CG> at geer street now
<@U1KT5F4SZ> I can't go tonight but if you go to another Bulls game lemme know...I live biking distance from there.  Have fun!
<@U1KRNTXL5>: I'll let you know! I love going to games so we'll have to pick another one coming up 
Just wanted to remind everyone about not adding dmitry kulyushin on linked in. He came up on my linked in suggested contacts and said I had a few common contacts with him. 
also, something else I just learned now is that the linked in picture we have gets populated to search engines like Google and Bing. If you are like me and don't want your picture to show up in the google image search, change your image settings in linked in: <http://www.businessinsider.com/hide-your-linkedin-profile-from-google-2014-1>
<@U1KRZT11T> building on your channel psa, how do you know when new channels are created?  Do you have to constantly check?  Often times a channel gets created and I have no idea until someone mentions it in person by chance.
Has anybody been able to download the linear algebra review pack solutions?  The link is on this page but maybe the document hasn't been uploaded yet.  <http://www4.ncsu.edu/~slrace/LinearAlgebra2017/index.html>
<@U1KRNTXL5> Yeah, it's not working for me either
<@U1KRNTXL5> I emailed Dr Race about that yesterday.  She replied back to say she'll have to fix it tomorrow.
<@U1KRNTXL5> Are you curious about a particular problem?
Awesome picture <@U1M4QJD4P>! Hopefully you are not hinting anything :slightly_smiling_face:
<@U1KRZT11T> - I think you just have to keep checking now and then.  People who create channels can invite people when they make them, but for the most part, you have to find them yourself.
Hello all - I have added the_family_channel for those wanting to organize activities for the entire family e.g. hikes, strawberry picking, etc. Feel free to join! :slightly_smiling_face:
Well hi there!
As ridiculous as it sounds, I'm thinking the solution is create a meta channel containing no comments other than listing other channels or newly created channels.  Or we could do the same in a google doc?  It really is hard to find all the channels.  I myself only found the social channel last week (which explains a lot in retrospect :expressionless:).
that's an interesting idea - every time anyone creates a channel, they post a message in the meta channel.
Or a page like this: <https://sites.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/msa-2017/home/msa-slack-channels> that the team can keep updated...

There is some ginger spice chai in the kitchen on the counter beside the refrigerator, in a stainless steel container (freshly brewed this am, so it's hot). For those of you who may not know, "chai" means "tea" in Hindi :slightly_smiling_face: Enjoy while it lasts!
The MSA site has been updated with a few new pages:
1. Due Dates page with key dates for us to be aware of (thanks, Amir!): <https://sites.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/msa-2017/home/calendars/due-dates>
2. Sports &amp; Rec page with useful links (thanks, Caroline C!): <https://sites.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/msa-2017/sports-recreation>
3. Blog Ideas that I have already received (Raj): <https://sites.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/msa-2017/home/blog-ideas>
To everyone who tried to look at the Linear Algebra review solutions this weekend, Dr Race has fixed the link as of this morning.
anyone heading toward the gym after our NDA talk today that I could bum a ride from?

Does anyone want to go to the brewery tour this Saturday, or need a ticket for a Friend/significant other? I'm looking to sell mine - can't go in the end :( 
It's $60!
For the Project Management Body of Knowledge we read section 1 and 2, but in parentheses there is 95 pages. Do we stop at page 95?
<@U1KQGK2CB>: no that's just the number of pages it is total
It's actually more like 140 haha
I think the Scrum Guide (16 pgs) seemed most valuable out of the entire reading set. Dr West was using that lingo in class today (backlog and sprints) and his reading guide says to read that particular item closely as it is the recommended PM style for our practicum projects at the IAA. Just my 2 cents.
Which Harris teeter is this??
The Cameron Village Harris Teeter has a special for college students--sign up with your VIC card to get a 10% off discount through the end of September; 5% discount through the end of school
Yay! 
FYI, the Raleigh Go Pass is $5 for NCSU students. After that one-time fee, you'll get free rides on local buses (Go Raleigh, Go Triangle) for the year. <http://www2.acs.ncsu.edu/trans/wolftrails/bus.html>
Has anyone had luck with student ticketing for NC State football? The GoPack website is asking me for a pin that I don't have.
You’ll get an email containing your pin! I just got the email with my pin

This is the Contact List with birthdays. Someone messed the sorting so some of the information is now incorrect. Please double-check+ update your contact list, birthday, cohort and neighborhood! You'll need to access it with your NCSU email IDs.
Don't forget trivia tonight at Sammy's.  Starts at 8.  I'll get there around 7:30-7:40.
<http://www.bizjournals.com/triangle/news/2016/08/23/n-c-state-nearly-sold-out-of-all-football-tickets.html>
Not sure if this applies to student tickets, but clearly we should get them as soon as we are able to!
I think they have a pool of student tickets allotted per game that are not sold and distributed in the student lottery. They also sent out an email today with information about signing up for the ticketing system. 
Yeah, I figured that only applied to the general public tickets. Good to see that people are excited about the season tho

Taiga is the PM software Dr. West mentioned as popular last year. <https://taiga.io/>
Dr West said that this software can be installed on the IAA server, so it's usable for confidential information :slightly_smiling_face:
I have a group of people coming in for the Notre Dame game in October, and I have a few questions regarding football:
1. Can non-students ride the Red Terror buses?
2. Can you get a student parking pass without getting a student ticket?
3. Any fun/unique traditions that occur Friday night or Saturday morning of game days?

Thank you!
Hot tea in the kitchen, for those who want it!
Remember to submit profiles before midnight, I almost forgot
Happy Birthday Dustin! <@U1KSL7L7R>
Gotta sing in class... 
We sang. <@U1NUU2U9E> 
Someone left a white Bible at my desk (blue cohort, middle, right side of the classroom). It'll be here waiting for you. If you were just trying to drop a hint, I'm always open to chat! :wink::innocent:
I forgot to send the message earlier - tea is served! :slightly_smiling_face:
I love that singing on people's birthdays is a thing now
<@U1L0V1X61> im coming for ya
I have heard that some people are having difficulty signing into Eduroam internet connection. You need to download eduroad for you to be able to access it. Go to this website and follow the instructions <https://net00xpc.comtech.ncsu.edu/enroll/NCSU/Production/process>
Should work for phone too
Hey <@U1KRZT11T>  did you talk to Brandon regarding Eduroam issues?  When I spoke with him he said that he changed his mind about Eduroam and was recommending that students just switch to using the NCSU network from now on.
<@U1KRZT11T> <@U1N43E3E0> I had similar eduroam issues and Brandon told me to just use NCSU going forward. He was able to set it up so that I automatically connect to it without having to authenticate each time
ditto
<@U1KRHCR7T>: any idea what Brandon did so you don't have to authenticate each time? Also, can your phone be setup so you don't have to authenticate each time as well? 
<https://sites.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/iaa-it-support/documentation/networking/nomad-device-registration>
Here is the link Brandon gave me for NSCU
Thank you!
Join <#C25143747|imflagfootball> if you want to play intramural flag football
woah <@U1KRNHQA1>  that is out of place
<@U1LNGEV0B> Yep, the link that Holden posted is what Brandon helped me with. I'm still on eduroam with my phone, and I haven't had any trouble with that.
I promise this is the last brewery tour message.  We have 20 people going Saturday and there are about 10 tickets left.  If your plans have changed or want to come along, please check the brewery_tour channel or message me for any info and details.  Friends/family are welcome as well.  Payment is ahead of time online via the link in that channel.  It runs from about 12:00 - 4:00 this Saturday.  Thanks!
<@U1KRHCR7T>: thanks for the info!
<@U1KR9BP0E>: are you still trying to sell your brewery ticket?
<@U1MBURU4D> I managed to sell it! :slightly_smiling_face:
John has extra tickets though :point_up_2:
<@U1KR9BP0E>: Ok cool. Figured I'd check with you first before I bought another from the website.
today is national dog day! (as in woof woof dog not hot dogs lol)
Also, National Women's Equality Day! :ok_woman:
I just sent out the survey asking you to select your preferred SAS Business Analyst &amp; Predictive Modeler test dates. I sent the survey to your ncsu email. Let me know if you didn't get it.
Nikki brought cake! It's in the cafeteria. Feel free to help yourself! 
THAT. WAS. DELICIOUS
Thanks <@U1L914KNJ> !
Does anyone know how to turn off the SAS certification email notifications?  I am getting bombarded by acceptance emails... 
In honor of national women's equality day I thought I'd share some good reminders for us all. This is for everyone, not just men- ignore the article title that seems to be pointed towards men. Women can have microaggressions against other women too, I see it all the time. I just think it would be a great opportunity to learn and check it against our own behaviors especially going into practicum, since we come from such a diversity of backgrounds and cultures: <https://notapattern.net/2014/10/14/ways-men-in-tech-are-unintentionally-sexist/>

And for women who feel themselves be the target of such microaggressions, here's some things YOU can do to make your workplace culture more positive:
<http://www.bustle.com/articles/114907-8-ways-you-can-shut-down-sexism-in-the-workplace>

It would be awesome if we could all read this and encourage each other to be more conscious about how our words and behaviors can impact women around us, both in the workplace and outside of it.
<@U1KRQLFLY> in your notification settings for the calendar, there's one that says "Receive an update when guests respond to an event for which you can see the guest list."
my guess is you have that checked
Thanks <@U1KQYG6SJ>
I don't know if I'm the only one, but I personally struggled to wrap my mind around the concept of the unit vector in Dr Race's review (question 11).  This khan academy series really helped me, and I hope this helps other people as well.  From here you can sort of imagine/extend the same principle to n sized vectors where you just have to divide each individual scalar in the vector by the  vector's euclidean norm to find out what the unit vector is that runs in the same direction. 

<https://www.khanacademy.org/math/precalculus/vectors-precalc/unit-vectors/v/unit-vector-intro>
The first football ticket lottery is open today!! Enter it if you want tickets to go to the football game this Thursday night! :grin:
<@U1LBRCSEA> I feel like someone asked you this before but how do I find my student pin? I only got an e-mail with my student ID number asking me to register for a ticket
<@U1LBRCSEA> nvm i found it!!! sorry
 Thanks for the reminder Beth :) Let's see if we can make it to the event. 
Does anyone know if there's  something we need to do to have tickets near each other?  It would be rather sad if I got a ticket from the lottery and then just sat by myself like a crazy person.
I think for student tickets there's a student section where you can sit wherever? Correct me if I'm wrong though 
<@U1L9DD1NY> is right! it's just general student sections so we should all be able to sit together!
Cool thanks for clarifying <@U1L9DD1NY>  and <@U1LBRCSEA> !
As long as you arrive at the same time 
They fill out 7/8 first (lower deck) then usually the end zones and 14/15 (deck above 7/8)
Since we are working on our resumes and one of the suggestions was to look at actual analytics job descriptions, wanted to share this with you all: <http://careers.analytictalent.com/jobs/data-scientist-28591187-b?page=1>
Seems to have REAL analytics job postings... not too many, but still.
If you have a moment, please visit <https://www.whatismybrowser.com/detect/what-is-my-user-agent>. I need a sample of user-agents (text in the blue box) for a project I'm working on. It'll look something like "Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/52.0.2743.116 Safari/537.36".
Thanks gang.
do you want us to send them to you here or dm to you?
dm or <mailto:mike.rose@ncsu.edu|mike.rose@ncsu.edu> . Thanks Max
Hey, anyone know how we can find previous students' resumes? I used to be able to find them on the msa website. But it seems they are all gone now. It might be very helpful to see those.
<@U1Q5GHC2J> do you mean the profile book or the actual resumes?
Daniel I think the resume book is locked. We need to request April for it. 
I don't remember seeing resume book online. 
Yes, the resume book is blocked. :(
does anyone have any conceptual experience/knowledge of text mining? I could really use some help :sweat_smile:
<@U1Q5GHC2J>  - I know I had seen it before. Did some digging, and found it!
<http://analytics.ncsu.edu/reports/MSA_Student_Resumes.pdf>
Thanks Raj!
Nice snippets from last year's practicums in those resume's for those that are curious
Just slightly better than "If I told you, I'd have to kill you."
<@U1L0V1X61>: Thanks, Raj!
interesting that just last year, they had addresses on there.
lol <@U1NUU2U9E>.  What a clever way to say "We did some stuff with some things."
Dear friends.  I have gone through the pantry at home and brought in the remains of the Valentines and Easter candy I found and brought it into the snack cabinet.  It's mostly chocolate, so it should still be good, but no promises.  If you haven't found the snack cabinet yet, it's number 22.
Does anyone know what exactly we're doing for our resumes tomorrow?  Do we have to submit something on moodle or is it something where we're just sharing in class like we did for the student profiles?
I think the latter
Bring a printed copy of the resume
Are folks still able to access the resume book link Raj posted? It works for me before, but now I'm unable to access it.
Julia and I can't either
Same for me :'(
Same lol
Ah yes, thanks <@U1L0V1X61> !!
let me know if the attached version doesn't work for you. I will send it in an email
Where would we be without <@U1L0V1X61>? Thank you!
Happy birthday michaelbyman!
<@U1KQYG6SJ>: thanks!
In case you didn't notice - there's tea in the kitchen. Enjoy!
Anyone know what time the game starts on Thursday? What time should we all aim to meet there?
It starts at 7:30, I think we can get in at 6:30 or 7 but there's normally a line to get through security
The parking lot opens up really early, I think at 2:30, so there is availability for tail gating too :slightly_smiling_face:
Oops.. Wrong reaction but potentially fitting in a deep abstract way? Idk 
For all those going to the football game on Thursday, I'm having people over to my house beforehand! I live within walking distance of Carter Finley stadium (around a 10 min walk), and there's ample parking at my apt building, so we can park there and walk over. If you plan on coming, respond to this post in some way so I can have an idea of how much food to get.

When: After class on Thursday - around 4:30 or 5:00 PM! We will walk over to the stadium around 6:30 PM!
Where: 5401 Creek Ridge Lane, Raleigh NC 27607
Who: Anyone! My apartment isn't huge but it's on the ground floor and opens to a little grassy area so I think there will be enough room
What To Bring: BYOB, I'll have some food, but feel free to bring more.
I'll be there!!
Can't wait!! <@U1KR9BP0E>  :tada::tada::tada:
FYI Python website temporarily down. Brandon is working on it. 
Hey everyone, I'm bringing in a brand new 1.5L french press and coffee bean grinder to make fresh delicious coffee for my morning huddles and lunchtime meetings.   You're all welcome to use it so long as you clean it, and respect when I need to use it.  Since I'll be burning through a lot of beans and half and half too I ask that you all bring your own.  I'll be doing the maiden voyage with this press tomorrow morning as I try and get the coffee to water ratio right, so come early if you want to taste amazing coffee, lets get brewing!!
Wow! I so wish I was in your practicum team :wink: #ohwaitIam :information_desk_person:
And I'll be bringing in some more of my mugs too!
Anyone at the institute right now? Do they have sugar there?
I am here... yes, there are packets of white sugar here...
btw - I brought tea made slightly differently today. It is made with cardamom, a spice commonly used in Indian cooking. Want to know more about cardamom? Read about it here: <http://theepicentre.com/spice/cardamom/>
All - I just got introduced to this app called Pocket Points (<https://pocketpoints.com/how>). Madison got a free pizza from Pieology, so we know it works! All you have to do to earn points is lock your phone while on campus/in class. And you collect points faster if more people are connected to the app - that's why I am advertising it :wink:
If anybody's hungry there are some leftover almond cherry pie bars in a black tuppwerware container on the top shelf on the first fridge downstairs that anyone is welcome to :smile:
<@U1L0V1X61>: does it recognize you as on campus? It doesn't seem to want to do so 
<@U1KRWUXFU> it seems to do so when you are on the campus wi-fi so either NCSU or eduroam
Some tips on putting PDFs into OneNote (PC version) so you can take searchable notes easily...

Set up OneNote to put the PDF on single "page"
- In Onenote --&gt;File--&gt; Options--&gt; Advanced --&gt; Uncheck the "Insert long printouts on multiple pages" option.

Printing the file into OneNote:
- Open the PDF file--&gt;File --&gt; Print --&gt; Choose "Send to OneNote" as your printer --&gt; Print. Onenote will then ask where you want to insert the printout.

Note: Sometimes the PDF images are turned sideways on the onenote page, so I print "multiple sheets per page" and choose the 1x2 option, which forces them into landscape mode.
If anyone needs help, come see me :slightly_smiling_face:
As a follow up to Ed's notes about one note: if the pdf or PowerPoint turns sideways, go into the advanced printing options or there might be something that says print using system dialog, go into this and change print mode to landscape then it will not come out sideways 
I've officially signed up for the City of Oaks half marathon on Nov 6. Anyone else thinking about running it? Definitely would enjoy some company both for training and on race day!
I have 2 tickets to the football game tonight that I'm not using. They are about 10 rows behind the visitor bench, at midfield. I'll accept the most intriguing offer. Direct message me here if you're interested 
Cardamom tea again today - enjoy!
Just connected to Pocket Points!
<!channel>: can we start posting the companies we get? Everyone is eager to hear
NOOOOOO
lol
can we just do this after everyone has found out? :stuck_out_tongue:
or after Orange Team 4 has found out? :joy:
<@U1KQYG6SJ> , can you just not look?  I'm dying to know!
lol
YOU'RE SUPPOSED TO BE PAYING ATTENTION IN CLASS ANYWAY
maybe I should shut slack down till the end of the day :stuck_out_tongue:
<@U1NDG6ULB>: I know you got your company... What is it?
We got Google!!!
That's mean... Funny but mean
We got Man U!
Sorry to hear that Kevin...
<!channel>: sorry to jump the gun... We need to wait to discuss the companies. Apologies. :upside_down_face: 
<@U1KRE1L9M>: if only :pensive:
I created a new channel called sponsors. We can all post our sponsors there and Rose doesn't have to see them.
<@U1KQYG6SJ>: 
Haha
Thanks 
Also, FYI, I get notified when you type my name, so you don't need to add my username after
just a heads up: an email about Linear Regression class from Dr Simmons ended up in my spam folder today, so check spam!

<@U1KRHCR7T> mine was there too! Thanks for pointing that out cuz I never check my spam
Don't forget business formal on Tuesday if you don't have enough time after class to go home and get back for our dinner event :-)
For everyone thinking strategically about their practicum and what language they may want to work with to get it done: keep in mind you don't have to commit to any one language for your solution!  Here are some articles I found about how to run R, Python, and SAS files from each other. I hope this opens up some possibilities for teams!

Hey--I'm headed with a couple friends to the Durham Bulls baseball game Sunday, 5p.  Let me know if you'd like to go!
Hey everybody! My roommate and I are moving into his new house tomorrow morning starting around 9:30. If you're free and want to help us out, we would really appreciate it! The address is: 1802 Crossroads Arbor Way #101
Raleigh, NC 27606. My number is 919-353-4199 if you have any questions.
It sounds like a fun practicum team bonding experience if you ask me!
Lol <@U1KSL7L7R> totally would if I was in Raleigh 
Anyone want a free shredder?
No thanks, don't need any TMNT toys
LOL! <@U1M4QJD4P>
Hey gang. I'm organizing a little excursion to Jordan Lake tomorrow to soak up this nice weather and sun. Low key BBQ/picnic/beach/swimming/hang out. Planning to get to the Ebenezer beach around 2pm with a few snacks, drinks, and charcoal. All are welcome. I'll be leaving centennial at 1:30 if anyone wants a ride! 
Timeline is flexible though :+1:
you had me until flexible :grimacing:
<@U1L5GU954>: still got space?
<@U1KQYG6SJ>: you bet!
<@U1L5GU954> do you know if dogs are allowed? It doesn't seem clear from the website
<@U1L914KNJ>: dogs are allowed!
<@U1L914KNJ>: I called this morning to check and dogs are allowed on any grass area, but not allowed on the sand 
Is anyone else's alias not working?  I sent a test email to myself at <mailto:ryan_wendt@ncsu.edu|ryan_wendt@ncsu.edu> and it didn't work, even though I got an email from the service desk saying they processed my ticket.
<@U1N43E3E0> Mine seems ok.  Did you try sending to it from a non-ncsu account? Sometimes aliases can be a little funny receiving messages from the same "account".
<@U1L1D4WG7>: thanks for the tip. That seems to be the issue. Strange that I can send an email to myself without using an alias but not while using an alias.
I think it's to prevent infinite loops of notifications about email... If you send to an alias, then get a notification to an alias, the emails would never stop...
enjoy literature? writing? philosophy? talking? I would like to start an IAA Junto. If you don't know what a Junto is, read this:

Just double checking, the email about logistic regression says we should do the questions before class on Tuesday but we don't have class tomorrow, so it means Wednesday right?
btw... this is obviously non-committal... just want some talking points with April. :slightly_smiling_face:
is it me, or the order of the answers goes  "1,3,2" ? a bit confusing
I see 1,2,3
Mine shows 1-2-3... interesting that it picked you (<@U1NUU2U9E>) on all of the categories by default...
<@U1L1D4WG7> i think it is because i installed the polling extension since i used it a couple of weeks ago... so maybe thats why?
Mine shows 2, 3, 1
Maybe it's randomized? Slack is up on its survey methodology!

Hi Everyone - There is a Dell Computer Charger in Swain (downstairs conference room). Come claim it if you are missing it :slightly_smiling_face:
Well hi there!
Heads up: there's lots of construction happening on Hillsborough, so I would suggest using Western or other roads until you have to get on Hillsborough to best avoid traffic and hold ups on the way to the club! 
Hello all,

A few updates have been made to the MSA site for students! <https://sites.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/msa-2017/home>

Here is a run down:
- Due Dates Calendar: Has been updated, and now we have 2 people cross-checking to make sure that the dates are accurate. You can add the calendar to your view by clicking the "Google Calendar" on the bottom of the calendar. See Amir (in Blue) or Sindhu (in Orange) if you have any questions.

- Moodle Shortcuts: Having a hard time navigating Moodle for the latest courses? We have created a page that collects the links in one place.}

- Python: We would like to introduce Kosta Blank to our team. He created a complete page dedicated to Python.

- Google Analytics: Caroline Collins has enabled Google Analytics support, so we can make sure that we are getting the page views we expect. We will share this with you as the program progresses.

- Coming soon.. Mike Hruska has shared some quick reference material for Linear Algebra. Be on the lookout for this - I will announce it once it becomes available.

If you have any suggestions, feel free to reach out to Raj Daswani. 

Thank you,
The IAA Site Team

If you want to help me do the write up to nominate Dr. LaBarr - your help would be appreciated! (we can also submit a nomination as a group)
Hey everyone. You DO NOT need your logistic regression books for this afternoon's class. She's just using her slides and the  Questions for Thoughts thing.
Fun Time Series Reminder:  If you see white, things are all right.  If you see blue, more work to do.
But if you're in R, you want the bars.
And if you eat cheese, you will have flees.
i just wanted to add on...
Fleas* <@U1LAAMJ0M> 
I cannot find my green Nalgene bottle so if someone finds it, please let me know!
I think <@U1KR9BP0E> has it....
^I was joking but she actually does
<@U1KSL7L7R> you should have come straight to me lol. I left it with Stephen in the room you were in!
Thank you so much <@U1KR9BP0E> !!
Sorry for stealing it by mistake!
I got two orders of summer noodles from Chirba Chirba but I only ate one and now I'm too full AND I have a stomach ache
what I'm trying to say is I am in the blue class room with an extra order of noodles
for any1
It's all good!
They are claimed
in record time
record time for noodles that gave you a stomachache... good thing my standards are fairly low
Can anyone help me understand how to dial out from conference room phones? The conference room phone says to "Dial 7 and then #". I tried to enter 7 and then my number as well as 7# and then my number. Neither worked. :disappointed: Why is technology hard?
7 then 1 and then the number
1 as the country code
Thank you!
For people who are struggling to keep track of due dates, here are instructions to put the moodle calendar into google calendar.  I found it easiest to create an assignments calendar and imported it into that so I could see just the assignments at once if I want to. <https://docs.moodle.org/19/en/Calendar_export#Google_calendar>
The only thing I would be aware of is if due dates change. I'm not sure if it will update

<@U1KSGHLPJ> thanks! its funny how the colors of the visualization are very similar to the institute colors haha
Just thought I would toss this in because it is built using JS, which Dr. H showed us earlier. :grinning:
Hi everyone, I saw we have a guest lecture tomorrow. Does that mean business formal? I don't think it does, but just want to be sure...
Yo yo yo
I was not told to do so, so I will not
anyone know if the optional session tomorrow will be recorded? it'd be nice to have that extra time in the morning if I could just watch it later at my own convenience...
<@U1KRHCR7T> we can ask Dr LaBarr to record it
no promises though
yeah, maybe better to be safe than sorry
I asked him earlier today, and he said he will be recording
Hello everyone, hello slackbot! I am moving into my new place this Saturday and would really appreciate the extra help in the morning and afternoon. I pay in pizza and can also endorse your skills on LinkedIn. Thank you! My number is <tel:(919)345-1936|(919) 345-1936>
Hello yourself
Lol. I love these payment methods
Just added an optional session Oct 4th (10:45) with MSA class of 2013 graduate Eric McMillen who is currently a Data Scientist at Uber in the San Francisco Bay Area
This will be a discussion on the different data science roles in the tech industry, as well as things to consider when navigating the hiring process. Additionally, you will learn how west coast technology companies can differ in their hiring and recruiting processes from east coast companies. (this also explains why the time series classes for that day are now combined).
Thanks <@U1XCJ1X4H> ! Sounds like a great session
Don't forget to set your fantasy lineup people. It's time for some Football!
<@U1XCJ1X4H>: is this like a regular employer information session/do we have to wear business professional? Are there signups anywhere? 
<@U1KR9BP0E>: we have to wear business professional and we all have to attend so I don't think there will be sign ups anywhere 
<@U1KR9BP0E>  You mean the West coast tech one? 
<@U1XCJ1X4H>: yes :)
It's more like the Radu talk today..so business casual.. because Eric isn't hiring. But keep in mind what Mary Crane said about first impressions. It will be in Bodie, so everyone will fit. No sign-up needed. 
I imagine some don't care about West coast, so.."optional"
Ok perfect! Thanks <@U1XCJ1X4H> 
Any recommendations for good restaurants near DPAC?
<@U1L1D4WG7>: I live right by there what type of place were you looking for 
<@U1KSEJ01W> open to anything, as long as it's decent :-). Closer to dpac the better.
American tobacco campus seems to be right next to it 
That has nice restaurants 
I used to work at Duke but just forgetting things right now 
<@U1L1D4WG7>: alright I'll give you some options. If you can get a reservation at bida manda and like Thai food it's probably one of the best in the city. For Italian gravy, cafe Luna, and San Marco are all good choices. Sitti is good for Lebanese/Greek. Centro is my favorite for Mexican. And Raleigh times is good for like a bar menu. Capital club 16 is good for An American menu 
Sorry San Lorenzo is the name. That's gonna be the closest but they're all within 5/6 blocks of dpac
My bad when u guys were talking abt dpac, I thought Durham performing arts center. Ignore me 
Yeah I'm confused now too haha are you talking about the one dt or the one in Durham <@U1L1D4WG7> 
Haha sry! 
DPAC is the one in durham, it is Durham Performing Arts Center <@U1KSBCBFG>
DPAC in Durham.  :-)
Ok thanks Hannah :) 
Okay well if you ever want dinner dt those are some good spots! Haha 
Near the Durham bulls park. I haven't been over there for dining out in ages.
Then go to the American tobacco campus Ed. I've been there once and it has a whole bunch of restaurants. 
<@U1KSEJ01W> thanks anyway Anthony!
I usually stick to regular stuff so I think I went to which wich or moes there but I remember it had a lot of good options 
I know my frnds really liked Cuban Revolution there 
I really liked Dashi -- ramen with a little southern kick (porkbelly, collards, etc.) It's about a quarter mile from DPAC
Tyler's tap room and Tobacco Road bar and grill are both right there and decent. If you're looking for something other than a burger or sandwich go to Main Street a few blocks away and there's tons of stuff 
<@U1L1D4WG7> my favs up there are pizzeria toro and mateo (tapas) but I've heard good things about Rue Cler (french) and there's always Tyler's Taphouse and Mellow in the American Tobacco campus if you are going more casual.  The Cuban place in ATC I do not recommend.
Bonjour!  Ça va?
Thanks for all the recommendations <@U1KSBCBFG> <@U1KSL7C10> <@U1L914KNJ> <@U1LHLK8MR> !!  Great tips!
And thank goodness for slackbot
Haha hope u have a nice time :) 
Dinner plus Ira Glass (from This American Life) at DPAC is a great date night :-)
Cool!! 
I am jealous 
<@U1L1D4WG7>: if u want to head to Main Street, I used to go to alivias and that was nice 
There are a lot of restaurants next to alivias and across frm it if u wanted more portions 
Options*
Pompieri is an awesome, brick oven pizza place
<@U1L1D4WG7>: I second Mateo or pizza toro if you want a nice date atmosphere. For something a little more casual I would say Luna or only burger. 
Just a reminder that Saturday is Beericana.  <http://www.beericana.com/>
I third Mateo! Growing up that's what my family always did before going to dpac show! Just make sure you get there early!
Did anyone happen to save the worksheet solutions for Linear Algebra for Worksheets 1, 2 and 3? (Or any of them?)
It's giving me an error when I try to open them on the website. I emailed her about it!
<@U1KR9BP0E>: I emailed race saying we don't have access to them 
<@U1L41DF9D> Haha I did too, hope she sees it! I'm working through them now and would be helpful to have the answers after each question so I can remember my reasoning...
<@U1KR9BP0E>: I agree!! If we both emailed her hopefully we'll get a quick response. I just want to make sure I'm doing everything right before I take the quiz. :see_no_evil:
<@U1KR9BP0E> I have them, I'll post.
Thanks <@U1L1D4WG7>!!! I know someone would come through :slightly_smiling_face:
I think those are the right files. Let me know if you are looking for something different.
<@U1L1D4WG7>  mightn't you have the worksheet as well from today's lecture? The interweb says I'm forbidden from accessing the site at all... :disappointed:
<@U1L1D4WG7> nevermind, Dr. Race just emailed them out. :slightly_smiling_face:
Does anyone know a good place I can get a bridesmaid dress tailored? :dress:
<@U1KQ9523D> I’m going to get stuff tailored at Glenwood South Tailors this weekend based on a recommendation from <@U1KQYG6SJ> and their Yelp reviews. They’re supposedly the best in town for alterations.
<http://leetailorshop.com/>
super nice, fast, quality
<@U1KRB11QC> <@U1M4QJD4P>  thanks guys!
Just used lee's for my suits! 
Any "This American Life" fans out there?
<@U1L1D4WG7>: my Monday morning ritual for years :)
I've got an extra ticket to see Ira Glass tomorrow night at DPAC. Marina and her husband are going also, but my date (my wife) fell through because we have a sick child at home. :-/  Any takers?
Omg what time!!! I would love to! 
8p show, going to grab dinner beforehand at 6ish.
Ed let me DM you!
<@U1L1D4WG7>: <@U1KR9BP0E> <@U1KRBJP47> 
I'm going as well!
So psyched to see this show.
<@U1L974M70>: we're heading to Tyler's Tap Room at 6 before the show if you want to join :-)
Ed's ticket still up for grabs- turns out I can't go after all! 
<@U1L1D4WG7>: I will claim it if no one else wants it
It's worked fine for me. Maybe it downloaded incorrectly? Check your libref?
oh, figured it out. When you download it a few times, google chrome adds a space and a number at the end of the file name... apparently there can't be a space in the file name.
Does anyone know what company the employer session is on Wednesday?
it was initially Accenture, but they got moved. I don't think we have a new one yet
I'm pretty sure Deloitte is still on Friday 
I can't remember who mentioned it to me (please take credit :slightly_smiling_face: )... but we are &gt;25% through the MSA program!!  :tada:
<@U1L1D4WG7> I feel like after we pass those 3 exams (and projects + hw) that are due at the end of the month, we will be about 50% through :weight_lifter:
Hey y'all, am I missing something on the logistic regression questions for thought? where is fireplace2??
<@U1NFS178D> it's in the folder of data that you can download from the logistic class page
ameshousing5 is the library
I only see "Fireplaces" in ameshousing5, and it's not a binary variable
<@U1KRBJP47> :fireplace2 is present in the data set. It is the last column
*sigh* I guess it's been a long weekend (I didn't see it because I thought the proc contents were in alphabetical order) Thanks <@U1KRNH021> and <@U1KRHCR7T> !
update: emailed Laura and she said there is no employer info session on Wednesday. Instead we will be having an optional lecture from 1-2 PM and she will update the calendar with those details as soon as she has them. Deloitte is still on Friday.
Just added the optional lecture: 1pm-2pm Wednesday. It's Dr. Healey's upcoming keynote presentation at the VISSOFT Conference to be held on Oct 3rd. Here is the link: <http://vissoft16.ysu.edu/program.html#keynote> 
He's also willing to talk about all the jobs he's had since finishing college if someone wants to wade in and ask a question about that.
The lecture will be optional - in Bodie (combined cohorts) - and you can dress business casual as usual.
PS: Friday is still Deloitte - you need your suits. They are bringing 25  people, so everyone should have a chance to chat with someone!
Lunch will be included and it's a full lunch - not just snacky food.
Going off of what <@U1L1D4WG7> just said.. I made channels for time series, logistic regression, and linear algebra. This way it will be easier to organize the information between the three classes !
My car=:skull::skull_and_crossbones::fire::boom:. Would someone who drives on tryon be willing to pick me up for class tomorrow? Live near aventferry x tryon. Mucho thanks.

<@U1KR9BP0E>  i would hang this in my cubical,  if we had those haha
<@U1NUU2U9E> hang that *thing* in your corner office
<@U1L46HXCJ>: did you find a ride? I have to be at school tomorrow at 9 so if you are okay with that and still need a ride just let me know! 
<@U1SMADBU4>  i found a ride but thank you!!!
Cat nip aka puppy chow (chocolate and peanut butter goodness) courtesy of Team Kitten will be in the kitchen today! Enjoy!

Darn it, bunch of people (including myself) are sitting up here waiting
FYI if anyone becomes interested in working for EAB or The Advisory Board Company, let me know and I can connect you with some people there. Referrals get more attention than regular applicants. Hope you enjoyed the talk today!
Oops... Graduate student online orientation :joy:
<@U1KQ9523D> <@U1M7AD5L2> : because I overheard you talking about the parolympics   <http://www.sporttechie.com/2016/09/01/technology/mobile/apps/inspirational-blind-runner-creates-app-to-guide-him-through-marathons/?utm_source=SportTechie+Updates&amp;utm_campaign=72659305a9-SportTechie_Weekly_News&amp;utm_medium=email&amp;utm_term=0_5d2e0c085b-72659305a9-294430817>
Hi all,

If anyone else is interested in going I’m heading out to Wake Forest next Tuesday for the upcoming RIoT event. The overall theme for this one is autonomous vehicles. See the link below for more info on presenters and their specific topics. I also created a new channel for anyone that wants to coordinates rides (I can take 2or3 with me if you live close to campus) or has more questions.
<https://www.meetup.com/NC-RIoT-Regional-Internet-of-Things/events/233245040/>
Well hi there!
Also, don’t worry if you try to join on the meetup site and are put on the waitlist I let them know I would (hopefully) be bringing along some of you with me. That said let me know if you are interesting in going so I can give them a rough count. Hope to see some of you there!
For those who don’t know what RIoT is (ps. we won’t be breaking or burning anything..not this time) check out <http://www.ncriot.org|www.ncriot.org> or feel free to shoot me a note. Doubtful I have the answer but I likely can point you to someone who does.
Heck yeah <@U1NDG6ULB> I love nerding out about driverless cars.
I have two football tickets (and a parking pass) to this Saturday's NCSU Football game that I can't use if someone would like to buy them. $25 each.
Section 14 / Row K (two padded seats with chair backs)
NCSU VS Old Dominion - Hall of Fame Weekend Raleigh, N.C. 6 p.m.
I'm not sure if everyone knows this but I asked Dr. Simmons  how she wants us to write the paper and she wants us to take a more technical approach (include p-values and such).
We also talked to Dr. Simmons and she said to assume your audience knows technical terms, but to also still write it like a business report! For instance, she said in tables she shouldn’t see MMBAL_bin, etc.
<@U1XCJ1X4H> will we have business cards prior to the Deloitte information session on Friday?
<@U1KRB11QC> Learned today that there was some kind of problem. Jessica plans to get right on it when she is back. So... can't tell yet. We thought so, but then this 'problem' came up so won't be sure until Jessica looks into it. Jessica is supposed to return Friday.
<@U1KRB11QC>: handwritten business cards, who has the best handwriting? 
Shall I Google "calligraphers"?
*Puts in rush order at vista print 
Photographer will redo pix tomorrow if you really hate your pro pix. Bring your fancy clothes...he's doing retakes after his class. Let me know so I can watch out for you.
If you want some ideas of how to shoot a group of five, do a Google image search of the Scooby Doo Gang <https://www.google.com/search?q=scooby+doo+gang&amp;client=safari&amp;hl=en-us&amp;prmd=isvn&amp;source=lnms&amp;tbm=isch&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjyp6atx5HPAhVIcD4KHVLaDNsQ_AUIBygB&amp;biw=375&amp;bih=559>
I like the stack 
If someone in your group is lighter, I recommend 
Has anybody seen a green water bottle in Bodie? I seem to have misplaced mine.. :see_no_evil:
Btw people who are using R vs people in SAS will receive different MAPE values for time series. Michael checked with dr. Labarr. :raised_hands:
To anyone who left a blue water bottle in Lincoln, it's sitting on the conference table!
Hey everyone! Above is a useful diagram to help you understand the model implications of the CMH and BDT tests from logistic regression. The diagram assumes you are trying to model 'y' based on 'x' and you think 'z' might be a confounding variable. Hope this helps connect some dots! Let me know if you have any questions. 
<@U1MDE4NAG>  Awesome! But where is the Byman statistic used? 
<@U1KRTU0UQ>: after I publish, so no one rips it off
Remember to bring your magnetic name tag tomorrow :slightly_smiling_face:
Thanks, Doc Proc!  
Check your business cards to ensure all of them have your name on it.  <@U1KQ9523D> I have a stack of yours
Goodluck everyone! We will all do great!
Do datawatch cards work on the weekends?
Cus I'm kinda locked out
They should work downstairs until 6 I think
Yeah.. I'm trying to get into okracoke 
Second floor locks at 5 on Fridays 
Finding that out now
Think it's open again at 9-12 tomorrow...
You need a place to stay tonight <@U1LMHQY9E>?
Haha nah dr Simmons was still there
OK.  Just checking.  Wouldn't want to have you sleeping in the parking garage.
Thanks! It was a close one haha
Has John sent out the computer security assignment?
<@U1L6WB44A>:   don't think he has yet 
Perfect, just wanted to verify I hadn't missed it! 
Is the CIA employee info session mandatory for everyone or just those who put their name on the interest list? 
I would imagine all are mandatory to show our program's enthusiasm for visitors, which is good for everyone.
<@U1KRTHAQZ>   I agree with <@U1L1D4WG7>.  It's most likely mandatory for all.  <@U1XCJ1X4H>  can verify this.
Was anyone able to open the linear algebra data for the homework?
Yeah <@U1KRTHAQZ> I asked April if I could sit it out and she said she wants everyone there! 
Gotcha! Thanks <@U1KR9BP0E> <@U1L6YQUSU> <@U1L1D4WG7> 
<@U1L3K1AKD> yes.
how did you do it <@U1KT2JJE8> ?
Just a load statement in R
did you open it?
In Rstudio you mean? Yes, but you can only see the first 100 columns
because I was able to download it, but when I open it I don't get a data set or a script....
How are you trying to open it?
If you go into RStudio, choose "Open file" from the menu, and specify the filename", it will give you a message asking whether you want to bring it into the global environment - hit yes, and it will show up.
I did it now <@U1KT2JJE8> ! I just had to use the load function
thanks!!
Is anyone planning on driving to DC the weekend of October 1-2?
Does anyone know what the cupcakes are for in the lounge...? :eyes:
Hey guys I got a flat tire on my car yesterday. I put the donut on, but I need to find a place to get my tire fixed. I know that people talked about good places to go before, but the messages are not on slack anymore so does anyone have any suggestions of places I should go to get it fixed?
Do you want to buy a new tire or fix your old tire?
It depends on what they tell me I guess. I would like to get it fixed if possible but if not then I will need to buy a new tire
The real question is, how old are your current tires?  If all your tires are getting old, it might be worth looking into a new set.
I am not really sure what to look for to judge the tread/wear on the tires
<@U1KRZT11T> i haven't had my tires changed/fixed but I got an oil change at C&amp;C (on western) - they did a good job and were pretty fast/professional.
<@U1KRZT11T> I always go to Discount Tire for tire issues! There are a few in Raleigh
In abt 10 min there will be fresh coffee in the French press for anyone!
Bonjour!  Ça va?
lol at whoever set "Bonjour" as a response to French: my guess is <@U1L6YQUSU>
If anyone finds a planner book that was given in the orientation please let me know. I left mine near the printer but not able to find it. 
New tires are expensive but you end up spending more money in the long run if you go cheap.  My advice is to find a friend who has a costco membership and buy from them.
I found it. Thanks Sneha. 
<@U1KRZT11T>  how to know when it's time: <http://www.goodyearautoservice.com/content/content.jsp?pageName=TreadDepth>
Check the tread and also how long they've been on your car <@U1KRZT11T> .  BJs and Costco both do tires.
<@U1KR9BP0E> <@U1L3G0YRJ> <@U1N43E3E0> <@U1L6YQUSU> Thanks everyone for your advice
<@U1KRZT11T> if you can find a discount tire, they will usually plug your tire for free (if i recall), assuming it is in the tread and not sidewall
<http://www.discounttire.com/dtcs/infoFreeFlatRepair.do>
<@U1KT9ATA5> thats awesome. I will check that out
Anyone interested in going to this event? 
I was signed up but gave up my spot because people were wait listed
Phil I did the same thing!
Haha communication is key
I'm interested!
Reminder not to forget name tag for tomorrow :ballot_box_with_check: (mostly @me)

Hope to see you there!
Maybe I'm one of the few that finds this interesting :slightly_smiling_face: ...but does anyone have connections with the NCSU horticultural department and can get us in to see the corpse flower that's about to bloom? It's a pretty rare event, so it would be cool to witness!
I can see what I can do! No guarantees though!
<@U1NFS178D>: you're not the only one interested in this
Has anyone found good practice questions to prepare for the Business Analyst certification?  Or any other resources besides the eLearning?
On the MSA google site under Moodle there's a link to some reference sheets made by a previous student and one of them is for the business analyst certification, I'm told the student made it after taking the certification so it should be a good resource!
Awesome. Thank you.
There are also a couple official sample questions on the SAS website for the test. There aren't many questions, but there are enough to give you an idea of what types of questions they'll ask. 
As we start getting ready for our exams next week, Mike has shared reference sheets with us. It is super useful!  Check it out here: <https://sites.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/msa-2017/home/fall-2016---moodle-links/linear-algebra-reference-sheets>
<@U1NFS178D> please let us know if you do find out.  That sounds randomly cool.  It looks like there is a live stream of it in case it doesn't work out though.

I'm going to Five Guys for lunch if anyone wants to join me.  It's by Crossroads.  I can't guarantee a return by 1:00, Orange folks.
Hi everyone. It seems as though I have misplaced my Deloitte bottle...canister...mug thing. It was in the upstairs kitchen at 12:30pm full of freshly gathered water from the water fountain. If anyone accidentally took it, would you mind shooting me a message? There was also an unclaimed Deloitte thing in the upstairs kitchen when I went to look for mine. It was hot and full of coffee. It had a little splash of red (maybe tomato sauce?) on the lid. Thanks!
<@U1L0V1X61> those sheets look fantastic! thanks a lot, <@U1KT1RZ24>! :smile:  :flushed:
no prob
it was <@U1KT1RZ24> :slightly_smiling_face:
Who all would be up for a Fall camping trip in the mountains? I’m thinking the weekend of Oct 15 over around Asheville. We can check out the fall colors, go on a few hikes, and hang out. Prior camping experience not necessary. I just need an idea of interest level to scout group campsites. Thanks!

<@U1KT3UELS> pretty sure that is what they say.
<@U1KT3UELS>:  mine did that yesterday morning during class... it didn't even ask me! :see_no_evil::flushed:
<@U1L2P17DZ>: same here! I was at the library and then it randomly started the million hour update so not :sunglasses: 
Sounds like y'all need to check your update settings for the time period that your laptop thinks you're idle
It shouldn't run updates during "non-idle" hours
Will do, thanks <@U1KQYG6SJ> ! 
I don’t like how Windows only lets you set 8 hours per day as working hour. As if we only work 8 hours per day...:face_with_rolling_eyes:
Is anyone else having trouble reading the feedback comments from Dr. Simmons on the returned homework?
The feedback wasn't showing up on my phone but when you look at the report in a PDF viewer (i.e. Adobe, Foxit) the comments show up.
Cool.  Thanks <@U1L93SMGF>.  I'll give it a shot. (Addendum - that did indeed work)
For those who are interested, they actually did open up the corpse flower viewing to the public...you can go see it tomorrow afternoon, although the flower may have already started to close up. I'm not sure if I can make it tomorrow, but just wanted to let you know! <https://news.ncsu.edu/2016/09/come-see-nc-states-corpse-flower/>
SOS the windows update unlinked the shared folders for my virtual machine does anyone know how to fix this problem?
You have to update the VMware and VMware tools. Brandon was able to fix mine for me!

Speaking of which, how is everyone feeling for the SAS certification?  It looks like it mostly overlaps with bootcamp and logistic regression class... but still it feels like we haven't gotten much direction  on how we're supposed to even be preparing for that.  I'm curious how others are thinking of getting ready for that or how much time we should be spending on it.
<@U1N43E3E0>: Andrea said something abt she studied for a week 
<@U1N43E3E0> i decided to move mine to november, unless an earlier spot pops up
<@U1KT9ATA5>: same I pushed mine back too
<@U1N43E3E0>  If you goal is only to pass the exam (that is 68% accuracy.) and assume that you master the material from stats 1 and logistic regression class really well, you should be safe.  You can refer to the exam topics on the SAS webpage to get an idea what will be covered. Link is : <https://support.sas.com/certify/creds/sba.html#s1=2>.    I studied for about 5 days.  There are several topics that were not covered in our class but appeared in my exam such as proc glmselect, three different methods of scoring, gains chart/ lift chart, purposes of training, validation and testing data set, how to adjust for oversampling, calculate cutoff using Bayes Rules. However, all these topics are covered in the SAS e-learning. So if you can go through the SAS e-learning once, you should be able to get a high score. Hope these help. Good luck.
In case anyone is interested, I've reserved room 4314 in the grad student area of the library until 3 pm today.  In case anyone wants to study near other people!
Thanks <@U1PN82U67>  that does help a ton. Just curious since it sounds like you have already taken it: how much emphasis did the exam seem to place on the programming side of things?  Going through the elearning questions it felt like they were expecting a pretty detailed understanding of the how the SAS options worked (and not just on statistical concepts), and that's going to be different from bootcamp where we had open notes for those type of questions.
Hi Everyone, Please refresh my memory - do we need to know the SAS and R code for the Time Series Exam??
Or just the concepts?
<@U1KR80QMS>: I think I remember him saying we won't have to write any code but should know how to interpret it
ok, awesome thanks <@U1KT3UELS>!
Sure thing! <@U1KR80QMS>  
<@U1N43E3E0>  I would say statistic concepts are important without doubt, but don't leave out the code part too. I couldn't remember the percentage (maybe 20%?) of code related questions, but I do remember that the questions I struggled the most are code related. I usually don't memorize SAS options and instead, I try to memorize what we can do in SAS and when I have to use a certain procedure or option, I use the help documentation. This doesn't work for SAS certification. So I would recommend to try to remember the most often used procedures and related options correctly. For example, in the model statement of proc logistic, to specify the category of response variable we want to model , which option can we use, (event=1) or (event="1")? The similarities and differences between proc glm and proc ttest? Which procedure can be used to impute missing values?  How to code a series of dummy variables by using array?  Options( I forgot which option) in Proc glmselect.  Options used to output certain estimates, specificity and sensitivity?  That is all I can remember.   However, every individual exam may be different, so don't rely on this questions too much. :grinning:
Hey everyone, just wanted to pass this info along. It's a data science competition hosted by Kaggle and Booz Allen in December. Looks pretty cool.

To all who have taken the Strengths Finder Assessment: You, like me, may be a bit lost on how to use your results. I just did an exercise that I found was really helpful. This exercise helped me sythesize the information into one digestable visual, helping inform me of what career paths are good gits. Here it is: I read my talent sections in the book and organized the points that stuck out to me on a spreadsheet. Then I bolded the points that really stuck out to me. Try it out and please share other ideas of how to use it!

Dr. Simmons is not going to provide the key for the assessment.
I'm power posing while I read the article for a sense of irony.
Is the peer feedback we're giving on Friday just for homework teams or for both homework and practicum teams? Trying to get mine written in advance so they have better grammar than last time (and so I have more time to cram for the certification Friday afternoon  rather than studying right now) :sweat_smile:

Say diagonalizable 5 times fast, enjoy studying.
<@U1L6WB44A> as far as i remember - we are doing both evals on Friday... but <@U1KQYG6SJ> is making me doubt myself... so don't take my word for granted :flushed:  I still think we are doing both though!
<@U1L41DF9D>: Thanks for mentioning this. I didn't realize we have a channel for logistic regression and timeseries. I missed the sample exam for time series. Glad I will not miss this one. 
Does one have to watch all the videos to complete the graduate student online orientation? Or can one just take the quiz at the end?
No need to watch the videos <@U1M37FW5U> 
How do you know you're in the clear? I took the quiz at the end and nothing happened.
You don't. I guess they email you if you need to retake it <@U1M37FW5U> 
Thanks <@U1L3K1AKD> !
Actually, if you stay on for a little bit and refresh the page, it will be graded 
How long does it take
When does that need to be done by?
3 minutes to take the quiz/survey
what sort of stuff is on the quiz?
If they were smart, they would look at the data Moodle collects and see video views. I wonder if they do that...
<@U1KSH8676> by Friday at some point
It's really nothing to freak out about.  I passed the quiz without really "watching" the videos.  You do have to click on the links since they track whether you open them.  The whole exercise is silly from our perspective because none of us are writing a thesis.
its also silly because we had already been in classes for two months before orientation
IAA should be exempt
I didn't click on any of the links and still passed..
<@U1L3K1AKD> Interesting I remember it showed something on the homepage that made it look like it checked that I had finished all of the videos.  It's possible that was just for show and they don't really check.
Hey everyone! Wanted to point out that SAS is accepting submissions for papers for SAS Global Forum until Oct 3rd! The conference is in Orlando in early April, and there’s also a Student Ambassador and Student Scholarship program you can apply for to decrease conference costs! Here’s the link for more info: <http://www.sas.com/en_us/events/sas-global-forum/sas-global-forum-2017.html>
<@U1KRLV1CG> not the creepy "grab the thumb of the person next to you" game?
<@U1KT9ATA5>  I am afraid I missed that awesome drill.
Remember to suit up tomorrow, and make sure you have your business cards and name tags :white_check_mark:
what's the link to the MSA google site again?
<https://sites.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/msa-2017/?pli=1>
thanks!
I thought I'd bookmarked it, apparently not
<@U1L0V1X61> i was totally absorbed with the test and forgot about that. you are a lifesaver!
About the Info Session tomorrow - since it's from 12pm - 2pm again - are we expected to have our lunch? Or will lunch be served? Anyone have an idea - if not, I will send April an email inquiring about it... I don't want a repeat of what happened last time
Lunch is supposed to be provided, last time was just a mistake
Yeah, last time the order got cancelled somehow.
Dang Papa J's...
Thanks <@U1LMHQY9E> <@U1KRSV7AN> 
Great job with three before me, <@U1L0V1X61> 
so we're a little over 30% through?
/giphy whoa
31.25%  #theydidthemath
And only 55 more school days until winter break! :hugging_face:
If you left your notebook in Bodie, I gave it to April!
If anyone is interested, my son Andrew is selling boxes of citrus fruit to support his participation in Marching band. Let me know if you want anything, and you can bring me a check tomorrow. Prices are in the photo; delivery is the first week of Dec.
Are checks the only form of payment?
nah, cash is ok too.  Just no credit cards. :slightly_smiling_face:
<@U1KT2JJE8> When is the latest date we can get you a check? My parents might want to get something too :smile:
I'm checking on that. Technically he's supposed to have it all in tomorrow, but as long as the order amounts are in the payment stuff can be worked out. Worst case, I'll just front for it.
<@U1KT2JJE8> I can get you a check tomorrow - my parents will reimburse me for that amount!
sure, just dm me what they want! :slightly_smiling_face:
coffee in 2 min
in the lounge
<@U1LBRCSEA>  (SAS Global Forum - April 2-5) ....students have marketing presentations April 3 &amp; 4. You'd have to clear it with Dr. D if going to SAS Global Forum.
<@U1XCJ1X4H> ah thank you for pointing that out, didn’t realize that!!
<@U1LBRCSEA> I think Dr. D picked that date b/c guests are coming to see the final Web Analytics/Marketing presentations. There seems to be other dates in that vicinity that are free (to work on your practicum final adjustments &amp; presentations). Perhaps she would consider rescheduling the presentations if SAS Global Forum was a draw for a number of students. You'd need to talk with her about it if interested.
<@U1XCJ1X4H> Ok, thank you for the information! :slightly_smiling_face: I didn’t look that far on the calendar, whoops!
Do any of us get to go to the SAS Global forum?
<@U1LBRCSEA> <@U1LMHQY9E> IAA does not send any students to SAS Global Forum - but, if you have the cash for student attendance or get in on the Student Ambassador and Student Scholarship program then......   BTW, I mentioned it casually to Dr. D &amp; showed her how open the calendar is around that time. She's completely willing to move the dates if the sponsor/guests can accommodate the change. She IS waiting for a student to approach her about it though, before she just goes moving it about.
For those interesting camping, we have a group site booked at Briar Bottom Campground on Oct 15! Check out <#C2EV5KFBL|camping> for more details and carpooling! :camping:
Severe thunderstorm warning + hail, in effect until 5:45. Stay safe
looks like nobody's Google Analytics certification made it to the profile book... is it not supposed to be listed?
<@U1NUU2U9E>: Sarah said they might be added later 
<@U1KT5F4SZ> so no need to email Dr. Rappa to let him know? haha
<@U1NUU2U9E> I would wait until this next certification happens. We'll all update our list of certifications and he'll have to add those anyways
If we're being totally honest Google Analytics &lt; any of the SAS certifications.  I'm personally okay if it doesn't make it's way onto the profile book due to space, but I'll still list it on my resume.
In the email he sent out he said it won't be on this iteration of the profile book
I dont know why I waited, but I asked Dr. LaBarr for his logistic regression R code, he said its for sharing!!!
New homework team is up on Moodle! 
<@U1NUU2U9E>: I told you I don't want to compete with you but instead to be a team. So we are in  the same team now.  Haha.
Quick question: for business analyst, what is the elearning that we are supposed to study EM 7.1 or 6.2?
<@U1L3K1AKD> At: <https://support.sas.com/edu/schedules.html?id=1860&amp;ctry=IN> it points to "Statistics 1: Introduction to ANOVA, Regression, and Logistic Regression" and "Predictive Modeling Using Logistic Regression (released June 2016)".
I know that says india,  but other pages are consistent with that.
Oh really?? haha Thank you <@U1L1D4WG7>
Maybe this is a better page for confirmation: <https://support.sas.com/certify/creds/sba.html#s1=3>
It lists the same modules. Conner took it yesterday and confirmed these 2 modules.
What are the hours for IAA today? I can't find the email :upside_down_face:
9-12
1st floor only
Thank you! 
I know rose beat me to it... But since I made the effort to screenshot it 
haha
<@U1KSR4JP3> the hours are also listed on the MSA google site home page
Ya^^^... that page has everything. Bookmark worthy :slightly_smiling_face:  <https://sites.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/msa-2017/?pli=1>
<@U1L1D4WG7> I’m guilty for not bookmarking the site….
Has anyone been able to find where Sarah posted the returned resumes? I can't find it. :confused:
<@U1KRSV7AN>: navigate to the same place where you submitted it and then scroll to the very bottom, it's kinda hidden down there randomly!
Oh, the whole scroll down so you can actually see what else is on the page trick...Got it. Thank you!
<@U1KRSV7AN>: no problem! Took me forever to find it!
When r we supposed to signup for sessions w her?
<@U1KSBCBFG> Sarah sent out an email on Sept 9 with the signup link
<http://www.meetme.so/MSA_Appointments>
Don't think I got that...might have gone to my spam :/ 
Thank u both!
Could someone who is not going to the notre dame football game next weekend request a ticket???? My sister is going into town!!!! Thanks go pack 
<@U1L46HXCJ> I am not going. Can you send me a link? I have no idea how to request a ticket
Don't forget business formal tomorrow.  Accenture visit.
Following along with <@U1L46HXCJ> can someone request a ticket for a friend I have coming to the game? :grin:
<@U1LBRCSEA>, no problem... but like Ioannis, I'll need a link, because I have no idea how to do it.
I can request <@U1LBRCSEA> 
Happy Birthday <@U1NFS178D> !!! :tada::confetti_ball:
Thanks y'all! :grinning:
/giphy party
Happy birthday Maria!
Niche article re: data, the Internet, and libraries. Interesting midsection on machine learning as deep fryer (not a typo) <http://idlewords.com/talks/deep_fried_data.htm>
Notre Dame ticket request closes at 8am!
I requested a football ticket because I figured someone would want it! So let me know if you need one :slightly_smiling_face::football:
The IAA Site has been updated with the links for the Fall 2 classes here: <https://sites.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/msa-2017/home/fall-2016---moodle-links>
As an FYI, April updated the employer info calendar event with the people from Accenture:

Margaret Smith
Samantha  Lee
Britni Burnett- Recruiter
If anyone wants a ride to SAS tomorrow let me know! 
<@U1L1D4WG7>: hey ed. Any chance you can let me into the grad lounge. I accident grabbed my Harris teeter card and not my ID when I walked out 
<@U1L9DD1NY> are you going back towards the Institute after it's over?
Yep! <@U1KT9ATA5> 
I'll ride then
Hey everyone. I was talking to April and Dr. LaBarr after the info session today about adding people on LinkedIn. They said to make sure to add everyone even if you didn’t talk to them. This is something that I was hesitant to do. If you didn’t talk to them they suggested saying “Thank you for coming to XYZ event. I’m sorry we didn’t get to connect, but hope we can connect now. I look forward to learning more about ABC company."
I forget, when it asks us "how do we know x?" what should we be selecting if we don't have their email for the "Other" category?
<@U1KSR1MS4> Friend bypasses the email issue. Also, the android app doesn't ask for a message at all, though it probably sends that generic one when you make the request.
Thanks <@U1L1D4WG7> 
I think you can "customize invite" from the app
For anyone looking to add the Accenture folks on LinkedIn, one of the names is spelled wrong in April's email. It's Margaret Smith, not Margarete Smith
<@U1L9DD1NY>: I'll ride with you as well if you don't mind
<@U1L9DD1NY> do you have room for a fourth?
<@U1KSR1MS4> I asked April this question a while back...she said choose whatever - they'll never see what you put :slightly_smiling_face:
Yes! <@U1KRHCR7T> <@U1KRE1L9M> 
<@U1NFS178D>: ah good to know thanks!
<@U1L9DD1NY> Great! I’ll find you after the west coast talk
I have room for one more spot if someone else needs a ride! :slightly_smiling_face:
Ginger spice chai in the kitchen. Get it while it lasts!
Does anyone remember the correct settings for getting a PDF in the right direction into OneNote?
