Hey everyone the first group run was a success. The next group run will be on Thursday morning at 6:30AM (Map attached). Once we have a few runs under our belts, we can figure out the logistics of what people want to do moving forward in the year. Hope to see everyone to see everyone then! <http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/1232813371>
Where specifically are we meeting? I gotta park in venture
<@U1LMHQY9E>:  Outside the main entrance to the building. Down by the fancy spinning door 
Here's the article I brought up on the run today:

<http://fivethirtyeight.com/features/the-5k-not-the-marathon-is-the-ideal-race/>
<@U1LMHQY9E> that is a really interesting article
<@U1LMHQY9E>
Cool article, everyone is always so surprised to hear I'm a runner with not much interest in running a marathon!
<!channel> Hey I was just trying to get a better grasp of what people are looking for. If you could fill out this form that would help <https://docs.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfFSo5d7nDl-ZbyNc7PTud7kk_qkBkHTwJ_57hMTrhhwr0yEQ/viewform>
Says I need permission? 
<@U1L7ERY77>: make sure you're on the right email. 
try it now
Is there a group meeting tomorrow morning to run? Or another day this week
I think the plan for now is still Tuesday and Thursday mornings at 6:30
I think for this week lets stick with the current plan because I am still compiling peoples preferences to find the times that work the best for everyone. We could do a reverse of the first loop. This week we can continue to start from the institute and then in later weeks we could try going other places. I have attached the loop, if you want to do a different loop just let me know! <http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/1242593608>
Can anyone swipe me into the parking garage? I forgot I needed my card for this morning 
<@U1LNGEV0B> we missed you this morning!
would anyone want to do this??

spoilers: it's the link for the tough howler that state is doing in october, could be fun
I'm in, I saw that and thought I shared it, probably one of those times where I don't follow through on good ideas :slightly_smiling_face:
I'm in! When is the sign up?
September 12, so we have two weeks to figure out details.
<@U1KT5F4SZ> I'm interested!
Ooh sounds fun!
It sounds like we may even have enough interest for multiple teams.  Good find Hannah (and Phil apparently)!
:+1::skin-tone-2:
looks like the sign ups start Sept 12 but you can sign up until October 21
unless maybe there is a limit the number of teams
Sorry I missed you guys this morning! I pulled my calf muscle slightly yesterday and didn't want to make it worse this morning. I'll be there on Thursday though! 
I'm in for the tough howler too!
Hey everyone! We are going to meet tomorrow morning at the institute at 6:30. This run has two possible routes depending on what you want to do. There is a ~4.2 miles loop and ~2.6 mile loop. What better way to get prepared to find out your practicum team. Longer Route: <http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/1246516810>
Shorter Route: <http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/1246511077>
As some of you guys know, I've officially signed up for the City of Oaks half marathon on Nov 6. Anyone else planning to run it?
I'm a maybe at this point. I am deciding between City of Oaks and a half the following weekend in the Outer Banks. But I will keep you posted!
Good job today! I will release what everyone responded for the survey soon. If you don't feel comfortable with everyone seeing your responses, just let me know and I will remove it
Hey everyone we will be meeting at Lake Johnson this Tuesday morning at 6:30. It is a 2.9 mile loop that we will be doing. We will be meeting at the main parking lot at 4601 Avent Ferry Rd, Raleigh, NC 27606. Look forward to seeing people there! <http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/1252012741>
Would starting at 6:45 or 7 work better for you guys or do you want to stay with 6:30
I like 6:30
Early bird gets the worm 
Ok 6:30 it is
I'm missing this one, let me know how it goes!
Running a few minutes late. Hopefully I still catch you guys this morning! 
Sorry guys my alarm is being dumb I just woke up you can leave without me
hi friends. If people are up for it I'd love to lead a run in umstead on Thursday morning.  since we start at 10:30 that morning it would be a great day to head over there so we'll have time to get there and run (its a bit longer, closer to 5) and get ready after for class.  Let me know if y'll would want to do that!
Yo yo yo
I like it. Count me in.
<http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/1256648392>
Route for Thursday morning. We're going to meet at the entrance on ebenezer church road. I'll get y'all a more specific address tomorrow 
Jokes obviously don't know how to share routes. <@U1KRZT11T> will you show me how tomorrow?
UPDATE - the link now works 
Still 630am?
Yep!
Hey everyone, is there an interest in adding a pub run club to our repertoire?  This may be an opportunity to engage some of the runners in the program who find 4+ miles out of their range as you can tailor the distance you go a little more.  I personally enjoy the Raleigh Brewing run club, there is trivia back at the brewery!
<http://www.fleetfeetraleigh.com/events/pub-runs-run-clubs>
Any runners doing the 9/11 memorial run? Event day details: <https://docs.google.com/a/ncsu.edu/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfK8fNxOS8vhe18B-5ON9v7TLg0A1eKobNLooZsdclTp9IrsQ/viewform>
Does anyone who lives near the institute want to carpool tomorrow?
Dropped Pin
near 5000 Ebenezer Church Rd, Raleigh, NC 27612
<https://goo.gl/maps/FH7EfDBq6fR2>
Address for tomorrow. The spots for parking are right on the street so it's super obvious 
If you have any questions or get lost call me 9192706452
<@U1L5GU954>: I'm at the corner of Gorman and western, if you want to coordinate
Sorry <@U1KT5F4SZ> (and group!) I'll be missing tomorrow
<@U1N43E3E0> sounds good dude 
sorry guys and gals, i wont be there tomorrow either. i know, thumbs down for me too!
We should figure out our teams for the tough howler on our next run!
Totally. Has anyone done the tough howler before? Is there a big advantage to having four on a team vs. two?
I've done a tough mudder. It was really fun with 4 people.
Yeah, I would assume a team of four would be better
It's cheaper with four people. That's the best advantage 
Good enough for me
Hey if anyone wants to join me this evening I am going to be at the nog run club anniversary run!
<http://www.nogrunclub.com/>
Run usually starts around 6PM at the Raleigh Beer Garden, followed by discounted food and trivia!
Do we have a plan for tomorrow??
6:30 at the institute?
630 at the institute, please :smiley:
My nose has been running more than I have ....so depending on how much of my cold clears by the morning I may be there but for a shorter run
Well you better go catch it. We can do the loop we did on the first day tomorrow at 6:30 at the IAA if that sounds good. On Thursday afternoon, I think we are going to do the "workout" loop after school
Hey guys there is no way I will be able to make it this morning. I have been lying awake for hours and still can't fall asleep
<!channel> Like this message if you want to do the Tough Howler in October so we can figure out teams!
Hey so I've had a few requests to lead a run through the workout stations on centennial campus, so I will be doing so this Thursday for everyone who wants to attend.  It's about 2 miles with 4 workout stations that include stretching, push-ups, pull-ups, some core work and some plyometrics. The point is to challenge yourself with some cross training and shows different levels for fitness abilities throughout.  So we will be meeting at our usual meeting spot at the institute on Thursday at 6:30 am.  Looking forward to it!  
whoever may be interested, i'm thinking of doing that run <@U1KT5F4SZ> led last week at umstead tomorrow morning probably between 8 and 9
<@U1LMHQY9E> I'm down to run umstead tomorrow! 
Hey everyone, on Tuesday our run is going to start in the small shopping center parking lot off of Avent Ferry Rd. and Gorman St. (In the lot near Walgreens). The route is a little over 4 miles. It will be an out and back so people are welcome to turn around early if you want to do less. Hope to see you there! <http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/1277021017>
6:30 AM
Hah, its almost like I pressed the out and back button...
Ideally I think the best run would be if I could find a hill that when you did the out and back it would be a bell shaped curve
Ew that sounds dreadful 
Not to a hill and statistics enthusiast like me
So is tomorrow happening with the weather concerns?
Rain or shine I will be there
Sorry <@U1KRZT11T>  I melt in the rain.
Tommy taught me how to use MapMyRun routes! Here's the route for tomorrow morning! Meet infront of IAA @ 6:30 for an out and back loop to Centennial Middle School with a mid-run lap around their track:<http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/1282142659>
I was going to try to randomize the teams for people who want to do the tough howler. I know we have done this a few times, but the past messages are too far back I so we can't see the responses right now of who would like to do it. Please like this comment if you are interested in the tough howler on Thursday Oct 27th
Hey guys I'm not gonna make it tomorrow, been feelin sick all day and have slept since I got home, going back to bed now
Hope you feel better!
<!channel> I'm coming but I'm gonna be a few minutes late 
Is anyone here? 
For the Tough Howler, I wrote the names down in the order I saw them liked. Then I decided to use pi to randomize the teams.
If this is not acceptable for you and I could use a real number generater
Team 1 is gonna kick all y'all's butts
Don't sleep on team 3
team 1 all day! we're going to crush this!!!
Very selfless of you to put all the best athletes on team 2!
Costumes should be required for all teams
<@U1KRZT11T>  when you signed us up did you pay $?
I didn't sign up yet
It's free?
It costs $30 I think but you don't have to pay the same time you register 
Oops I lied
Think it is $40 for a group of 4 and the $30 is for a team of 2
yeah those are the prices I remember seeing
not too bad considering tough mudder is over $200 per person!!
Umstead later today anyone?
Hey people. Anyone got any opinions on the distance for tomorrow? Since we don't have class tomorrow it can be a longer run. Also everyone okay with starting at 8? 
5-26.2 would work for me
no tommy....no. Also, what is the date for the howler and where do your randomized teams sign up?
Oct 27th and we have to sign up on IM leagues. I will sign up team 3
Team 1 we need a good name.  So brainstorm and we can chat when we're all back in class later this week
Everyone need to sign up for IM leagues for me to be able add you to the team
I keep getting a suggested post on facebook for a half marathon in yellowstone. I keep ignoring it, but I think facebook is telling me to do go for it. It's June 10, and I'm seriously considering it as a treat-yoself moment before working after graduating.
<http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/1290037696>
<http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/1290042118>
<http://www.mapmyrun.com/routes/view/1290046183>
Options for tomorrow - based on how we're all feeling at the end we can change the distance.  But Reedy Creek entrance at 8 am tomorrow!
Just a heads up to those driving on 40 that way, traffic is usually really bad from Gorman through US-1/440 interchange at the morning rush-hour.
I'm at the entrance guys <!channel> 
<@U1N43E3E0>: ha very funny. Does anyone want a ride
Just to know it's off Harrison Avenue
Stuck on wade, hope to be there in 5
Nvm eta is 8:05
<!channel>: there is tons of parking in the park. Disregard the cars all along the road as you drive in 
Lol I actually did show up at 630 and drove home when I couldn't find anyone :neutral_face:

Are we running tomorrow?
i'd like to
I have not created a route for tomorrow, anyone want to take charge of it, if not I will just make tomorrow a shorter day, maybe a 3 mile loop
what if we run past the gym again but just cut back earlier than last time to shorten it up.  I liked that run
yeah that was a good one
Sounds good 
I'm out for this morning, have fun!
I got some thunder and lightning going on over here, should we hold off today?
I just saw lightening and I am already back in my bed

Anyone want to run tomorrow?
What time

I'm going to do a practice half marathon tomorrow if anyone else is feeling brave.
I got the real thing next saturday :scream:
Too far, not ready
How about we do 9 and then anyone who wants to add on a few can do a half
You can do your own thing if you want to.  I'm trying to replicate the actual race map, so I'm planning to drive to North Hills.
<https://race131.com/files/uploads/1464115658_Raleigh_Spring_2016.pdf>
Well by 9 I meant am, not mi, but I'll see what I can do
My bad, different route for spring. <https://race131.com/files/uploads/1473698544_Raleigh_Fall_2016.pdf>
Anyone want to run in the morning-usual place and time?
I am going to do the track meet tomorrow so I will pass tomorrow
I'm out this week.
