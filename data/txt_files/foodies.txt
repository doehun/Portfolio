<@U1L5GU954>: 
<@U1KT3UELS>: 
Greek food tomorrow?
I've heard Neomonde is good for that! I also wouldn't be opposed to really good BBQ (comfort food for the next week)
Neomonde is amazing! I'd be down for that :grin:
I am also in for Neomonde
I'm out of town but I'm down for whatever outing we pick next weekend! Thanks for making this David!
Foodie outing for tonight: Mediterranean food at Neomonde at 6:30. 
Awe man, I thought this was plans for Sunday! I have dinner plans for tonight but I will def join you guys next weekend!!! Enjoy Neomonde, it is one of my faves :yum:
We could do Sunday if that works for more people.
That would work better for me too! 
Sunday night it is. I also heard from a local that there is a better greek place on Glenwood if we want to try it out
Taverna agora is a little pricey but is really really good if you want to try it out. Great place to eat 
Neomonde tonight around 6:30 for all the foodies out there.  
:round_pushpin: Neomonde

Alpaca Peruvian Charcoal Chicken (pollo a la brasa) is straight :fire::fire::fire: Who would be interested in trying?
That looks delicious! That's at Neomonde?
No, at Alpaca! Lol
<@U1L7RPG1M>: definitely at some point. That looks delicious! Does anyone need a ride to Neomonde from the avent ferry area?  Let me know!
<@U1KQ9523D>:  the count is 5 now!
Got neomonde for lunch today! Definitely recommend it! 
Anyone up for a foodie outing tonight? 
<@U1KQ9523D>: <@U1L3G0YRJ> what type of food should we try?
<@U1KQ9523D>: were you the one who posted about an Ethiopian restaurant a few weeks ago? That's could be an option for tonight!
<@U1L3G0YRJ>: Yes! Unfortunately I can't do tonight anymore :disappointed: , but I would def try the Ethiopian place next week?
Sorry you can't make it tonight <@U1KQ9523D> would anyone who can make it like to try Tasty8s gourmet hotdogs?
Time? 
How does 7 sound?
For all the foodies out there who need to soothe their souls after Communications Training or prepping for SAS certs...tomorrow is bottomless mac-smack-and-cheese night at Tuepelo Honey Cafe for only $10. Respond with a :+1: if you're interested. Starts at 7 PM. 
What is that? 
For all you foodies, next week is Downtown Raleigh restaurant week! <http://www.godowntownraleigh.com/restaurant-week/about>
Foodie outing for today: Duck's Dounts this afternoon <@U1KSYP1M5> <@U1KRWUXFU> 
I'm free anytime after 1!  
I was thinking about sometime between 2 and 2:30. I can give up to 3 people a ride there.
I can do 2:30! 
<@U1KRB11QC>: which location??
I think this one is closest 100 Wrenn Dr #101, Cary, NC 27511
I can drive up to 4 people! But I need to stop at the target in Cary afterwards to pick up a few things! 
See you all soon
:doughnut::doughnut::doughnut:
I'm inside! 
Since we have some extra free time today, anyone feel like a foodie outing for dinner?
Where are you thinking?
Hah no clue. I just figured I'd get the wheels turning
Here's some options I've seen that look good (prices vary so here's a heads up):
- H street kitchen - ajisai Japanese fusion - irregardless cafe 
If you haven't been yet The Station on Person st is a good one to check out.  
<@U1KRMNVGC>: I may be down, keep me updated if you guys decide anything
Does anyone want to do one of the restaurant week specials this Saturday??
I'm out because of a group meeting, but I totally recommend lucettegrace's PBJ macaron for dessert based on yesterday! 
<@U1L3G0YRJ>: I'm in! 
I'm out because of a team meeting as well
Julia and I are going to go try Gravy's restaurant week special tomorrow night (we switched the day) and would love for people to join us! There is a $20 dinner and the special menu is listed here: <http://www.godowntownraleigh.com/restaurant-week/menu/13> If you would like to join us please like this message by 3 pm today because reservations are going fast!
It looks like both cohorts finish at 12 on Friday, would any <#C1UEKR5KR|foodies> be interested in going to lunch around 1PM?  One of my favorite spots for lunch downtown is called Sitti and they specialize in Lebanese cuisine. Let me know if anyone wants to join!  

<http://www.sitti-raleigh.com/>
I'd be up for that!
Lunch is still on for anyone who wants to join.  Sitti downtown. 
Is their service usually quick for those of us going to the Python class this afternoon?
Depends on how many people join us / how busy they are.
Anyone want to get dinner tonight? 
Where are you thinking about going?
One idea is there's a really good cheap taco place about 10 minutes from the institute! But I'm flexible!
Anyone has any brunch places to recommend?
Joule coffee in downtown in awesome.
Tupelo Honey Cafe in Cameron Village has a pretty good brunch menu and they do great specials on mimosas some weekends! (Priorities)
Thanks guys!!
<@U1KRZT11T> and I want to go try Neomonde for dinner tonight, who wants to join?
Any interest in a foodie outing tonight? Possibly H-Street Kitchen
I went there last weekend. It was awesome. And I'd be down to go back tonight
Does 7:00 PM work for everyone or do you want to go earlier?
I WANT TO GO
are we still shooting for 7?
Yes sir! 
Upstairs!
We're sitting upstairs on the patio 
anyone want to join me at The Morning Times?
<@U1KQYG6SJ>: Sparkcon the creative festival is happening downtown today.  You should check out the exhibits and the street chalk art on Fayetteville! 
I'm a little confused lol
do they have breakfast at this festival, or is this a separate suggestion? :smile:
While you enjoy your coffee from The Morning Times, you should walk around and take in the sites! 
Breakfast not included :-1:
gotcha
David and I are going to eat at Kabob and Curry tonight @5:30 if anyone wants to join!
I was gonna go try this Peruvian chicken place in like 30 minutes. Anyone is welcome to join. Just let me know 
Weird! I was just checking for Peruvian chicken places today!
Let me know how it goes/which one you went to!
Was that Alpaca? That place is good!
No I went to mami nora's. and it was awesome. I definitely recommend it 
I think that's the same place. Or at least the Alpaca I'm talking about used to be called Mami Nora's. The food hasn't changed.
