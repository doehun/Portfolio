We got tickets on fandango. On our way.
I'm in the third row from the back when you get here
was it worth seeing?
it was...fine
ok to archive this channel? not because I didn't like the movie (I didn't), but because I do routine clean ups of channels that are unused
past messages will still be accessible
going once...
