Question - have we learned what to do if we don't have white noise for ESM? 
<@U1L41DF9D> esm is the most complex model we've built so far so I don't think there is anything we can do if we don't have white noise. More complex models like arima should get us to white noise, but we haven't learned that yet. 
Thank you <@U1KRNHQA1> 
Does anyone know if dr. Labarrs explicitly said we shouldn't use Browns double esm model because of how it estimates the parameters? 
He definitely said people don't use Brown. I think it was because of how it used theta in both equations
Right that's what I thought but for the hw when you run them all brown gives a better mape between the three. I thought you didn't use it might just throw it out 
<@U1KSEJ01W> I've found that when looking at MAPE, models you'd expect not to do well actually end up doing pretty well. But looking across multiple diagnostic statistics (RMSE, AIC, etc.) can give you a better idea of exactly how well the model performs compared to other models. 
<@U1KRTHAQZ>  thats a good call. ill look into that i got tunnel vision from prompt
Hey quick question about differencing for trend:

If your initial test has a high p-value, that indicates to take the first order difference.  If you take that first order difference and you then have low p-values, does that then indicate we need to perform regression on the trend?  Is it that differencing handled the trend?  Is it that we need to build a regression model on the differenced trend?  If there are horse shoes, are there any horse socks?  Is anybody listening to me?
<@U1LMHQY9E>  Usually if you have low p-values after taking the first order difference that means you fixed the trend and you now have stationarity
But you should proc eyeball your differenced data to make sure its not trending anymore
Thanks <@U1KRNHQA1> for confirming that.
<@U1LMHQY9E> There is a time series flow chart on the Time Series page that I found really helpful!
From today. 
Hey!!!! If anyone puts together practice questions or quizlet things can you please post it on here? Trying to get a grasp of some time series questions he could ask us. THANK YOU :slightly_smiling_face:
until somebody (hopefully) makes one, <@U1KQGRG2F> you can start with the info he posted as a "review" on his website -&gt; Time Series Review Topics and Answers
Hi all, I'm working through the review for the test and got to the question about "desired error". After seeing his explanation on the answer sheet it made sense, but does anyone know where we discussed this? Was it during the first lecture?
Has anyone looked at HW3?  Did we go over how to output data from an AR or MA forecast?
<@U1KRNTXL5>: dr. LaBarr sent out an email recently with code on how to do it. The email was sent out within the past few days 
Thanks, that helps!
<http://support.sas.com/documentation/cdl/en/etsug/60372/HTML/default/viewer.htm#etsug_tsdata_sect021.htm>     Ok here's how to get the whole forecast output from proc arima.
Hey on homework 3 is says to report the whitenoise for the final ESM... assuming that is a typo but does it mean that he wants white-noise for the AR/MA models that we chose or the final model that we selected for each city?
For TS, on Slide 30 of the first "intro to TS" class, does anyone know what the log formula means? Do we have to know this?
It's a way to transform multiplicative seasonality into additive seasonality if you wanted it. I believe the reason for doing this is that additive seasonal models are easier to build 
gotcha, thanks <@U1KSEJ01W>!
no problem! I feel like if you know why its done and what it does you should be good to go
anyone know the ods table name to output the residual P-values in proc arima?
Can someone explain why random walk is NOT stationary?
In order to be stationary the residuals would have to hover around some mean.  A random walk has residuals that hover around some drift.  Basically the way I think I understood it is a random walk is actually trending?
Isnt that random walk with drift?
I believe that a random walk isn't stationary because it doesn't have a constant variance over time.
Random walk with drift is a common stochastic trend model! <@U1KR9BP0E>
Control + F to "Pure Random Walk" for your answer
<http://www.investopedia.com/articles/trading/07/stationary.asp>
<@U1KSYP1M5> our group thought it meant whichever model forecasted sales best for each city....could be ESM or could be the stationary model
okay yes that's what we assumed, thanks <@U1L0RBZFH> !
no problem!
If anyone is confused on time series (like me) I made this flow chart that summarizes what we learned this semester!
Thanks, Emmy!!  This is great.
Hey  guys, I created a quizlet for time series: <https://quizlet.com/152478527/iaa-time-series-1-flash-cards/> (it includes Dr. Labarr's questions from the review sheet and questions/answers from my notes)
Does anyone know for the component form of esm models, is the level component the error term? 
I think level is the fitted value.
l(t) = y.hat(t+1) 
         or
l(t) = y(t+1) - e(t+1)
the indexing is a little screwy.  l(0) is fit for y(1)
only referred to level component if no trend and season components
found this site super helpful. <https://www.otexts.org/fpp/7/1>
<@U1M4QJD4P> thanks!
Hey all, I'm going through the review for time series and I had a question about AR models. Under the AR section, we're shown an equation with 1 spike in the PACF. Does anyone know what this equation would need to look like to have 2 (or more) spikes in the PACF? Would it simply need another lag in the equation (Yt-2)?
<@U1KRSV7AN>
Yes. but that is kind of a backwards way of looking at it.
if you saw two spikes, you would then know to try a model with two lags
.. i think (?)
<@U1M4QJD4P> Yes, I think that makes sense when it comes to the diagnostics. And if I'm just looking at the equation (as LaBarr shows us in the review questions), if there was an additional coefficient of Yt-2, that would mean we have two spikes in the PACF, right? If I'm understanding you correctly I think the answer is yes, but I'm not positive.
Or two lags in the graph before fitting the equation.
Which is why I think you mentioned it's backwards (after you fit the equation, there are no spikes in PACF).
Can someone explain to me, mathematically, why having a unit root is a problem? Is it because the effects of the lags won't dissipate over time?
<@U1KT2JJE8>: yes that is correct! The correlation function will just stay at 1 instead of reverting back to the mean! 
<@U1KT2JJE8>: I think then it doesn't revert to the mean eventually so it's not stationary 
thanks <@U1L41DF9D>! So in my notes, I have that the Dickey-Fuller test is testing for a unit root vs. abs(phi) &lt; 1. If abs(phi) &gt; 1, are we supposed to spot that before running the test (how?), or is the test still valid?
Is phi &gt; 1 I believe your lags will get bigger over time instead of smaller. He mentioned in class this means you are using today to predict yesterday which is pointless. I think it's not something he'll ask since it's not likely to ever occur 
is there a practice exam?
<@U1LMHQY9E> LaBarr has review questions posted on Moodle
are the answers on there too?
yes -- at the bottom of the page.. get it together phil
Outside of the ARIMA coefficients in terms of lags, what else could we need a calculator for tomorrow's test?
<@U1LMHQY9E> found this exam online - has some good calculations <http://harbert.auburn.edu/~champch/stat2610/championhw/Final%20Exam%20Practice%20Problem%20Solutions%203600%20sp13.pdf>
i guess MAPE, RMSE, sMAPE, etc. as well
that's an intense exam
lol
hey everyone, i am in the process of moving so most of my stuff is packed up and i can't find my calculator... anyone has a spare? or could i borrow someone's who is in the blue cohort?
<@U1NUU2U9E>  I have about 5 different calculators! I can bring you one!
<@U1L6WB44A> thank you!
am I correct in thinking that you can't account for a damped trend inside a seasonal Winters model?
<@U1KT2JJE8> I think you can. You would just multiply the trend by a weight, phi, that decreases exponentially over time. Not entirely sure. Can someone else confirm this? 
<@U1KT2JJE8> <@U1KRTHAQZ>  According to the textbook you can: <https://www.otexts.org/fpp/7/6>
<@U1KT2JJE8>: you can't do it in sas 
U can do it manually but u don't need to know that 
<@U1L6YQUSU> did you come up with a good rhyme for PACF and ACF for AR and MA - which one do we look at for every model? I still remember the white noise one :  "... if you have blue - you have more work to do..." in SAS haha 
That was a good one!
ARP and MAQ
ARPACF
idk good enough
just remember my lackluster efforts
MA is a shock model, you see the shock right away, just look at the graph where the name starts with "A" :slightly_smiling_face:
ARPMAQ? AFLAC? :hatched_chick:
@sharon <@U1KRTHAQZ> you can account for a damped trend inside a seasonal winters model - <@U1MDE4NAG>  looked at this for our time series HW1 as one of our models and Dr. Labarr taught us how - hard to do in SAS, but easier to do in R
<@U1NUU2U9E>  I got nothin'.  But you should know that you look at both the ACF and PACF for every model because they BOTH tell a story.  Each is one side of the coin, as Dr. L. would say.
Just remember that PACMAN exponentially eats dots from the maze.  This means the PACf decreases exponentially with the MA model.
That's what I'm talking about, <@U1L6YQUSU> !
Then you got it, <@U1NUU2U9E> .  I'm here all night.  I'll take Linear Algebra requests tomorrow night.
Don't forget a calculator, everyone! 
<!channel> test available for pickup in Dr. L's office
Does anyone know if LaBarr is leaving early for Friday? Will he still be around you think if I show up in 30 min?
he's still got office hours for another half hour or so
til 4 actually
sweet
thanks <@U1LMHQY9E>
He's still here right now.
<@U1L914KNJ>
thanks!
did anyone get this error while trying to build an arima model for hw3?
Error in optim(init[mask], armaCSS, method = optim.method, hessian = FALSE,  : 
  non-finite value supplied by optim
ew is that R
haha yeah
After you take a linear trend in R, what exactly do you put in the Arima statement. The residuals? 
visualize the ACF and PACF, then decide on what model you are building depending on the spikes you see in those 2
