Yessss
100% in!
Yes. 
Sign me up.
I'm in 
Its 7 players on the field at a time so I'm gonna cap the first team with the first 9 or 10 of us to join this group. Looks like we're all men so do you guys wanna do the men's competitive, men's recreational, or grad/faculty league?
Well technically were grad
Yeah but we're still eligible to play the other leagues. If we do grad we could end up being the only team that's not co-ed
I vote mens rec 
I'm with Phil.  men's rec sounds good.  People take it way too intense in competitive.
team name suggestions?
Rappa's Rascals 
Institute's
Athletic
Analysts
when does it start?
(that should be our team name but also would like to know when it starts)
The season is September 6- October 25
Just sent the invitation email to all of you to join. Try to accept it asap cause we need at least 6 people on the roster by Sunday
I'm not sure if I actually accepted, I clicked the link and it took me to the site, which I'm already registered with, and it didn't have anything else for me to verify...
<@U1LMHQY9E> you're not on the roster yet, I just resent the link to you. But if it doesn't work you can join the roster at the first game with your student id
I think I did it right 
Yeah it worked!
I have to wait for approval for some reason. It said my account info doesn't match the schools info...?  I'll keep checking to see if my account has been approved, but I may not be able to join by Sunday.
I just started physical therapy for my knee, and my physical therapist recommended not running for 2 months so I'm not going to be able to play fellas. I was hopeful I could, but she recommended strongly against it. I hate I can't play, but good luck this season!
Sorry to hear that man, hope you have a quick recovery! 
Praying for a speedy recovery bro
I think i'm on the roster
Thanks fellas!
ill play if you need another
Just sent you the invite Nick
Accepted.
<@U1L7RPG1M> <@U1L974M70> <@U1MBURU4D> <@U1MDE4NAG> <@U1LHLK8MR> <@U1KT9ATA5> <@U1L3PU7BJ> any interest in flag football intramurals?
Definitely in.  How do I join?
Peter will send you a link to join
I think we should set up a practice and see what we got, maybe get a game goin
I'm in for sure if possible
^meaning if there's a spot
Can y'all do either tuesday or thursday at 6:30?
Those are all available^
<@U1MDE4NAG> added you
Thursday works best for me. Tuesday is our IAA fantasy draft night
thursday (or wednesday) is better for me that tuesday as well
Same boat as <@U1KRB11QC> 
Yeah either day works for me 
Great, I'm in. Any day works for me as long as we're talking 6:30pm, not a.m. haha
Thursdays work for me. We can celebrate wins (and losses) with Thursday night football.
Sounds good. Gonna sign us up for Thursdays at 6:30pm
starting september 8th
When do we want to do our first practice game?
Maybe this Thursday at 6:30 since we don't have a game?
This Thursday is first ncsu football game
Forgot about that, nevermind!
Anyone want to throw the football tomorrow after class? 
4pm 
I'd be down. 
Is there still room on a team for one more? 
I'd be down too
Cool there are a few fields on centennial campus we can go when we get out 
I'm down 
<@U1KSEJ01W>: just added you 
Nice thanks man! Do I need to sign up online or something like that 
No problem! You should have gotten an invite sent to your email. Just follow that link and make an account if you don't already have one
Alright thanks man 
<@U1KRNHQA1>: I'm trying to accept the invitation but it's giving me an error, I think I have to put the campus id for the team in manually. Do you know what it is? 
Hmm I'm not sure what that means. But you're not actually required to be on the roster to play. Just bring your student ID to the first game and they can add you to the roster there
That works for me 
I'm good with any day!
<@U1NDG6ULB>: what field are we meeting at today? Centennial fields or there is also 2 decent sized grassy areas at the Oval?
Centennial fields works 
Blue should be out at 4 then i'll be there 
Not sure if you guys have any more room on the team but I'm interested
<@U1L1WFNC8> we got room, just bring your student id to the games and they can add you to the roster there
<@U1KRNHQA1> awesome thanks! 
no problem! we're gonna be playing thursdays at 6:30pm starting september 8th (i think)
anybody have a football?
It's not the best but I've got one 
I don't have one
I do
Blue team just got out heading there now 
<@U1KRB11QC>: <@U1LMHQY9E> <@U1KRNHQA1> 
If you don't mind waiting for me to change could I grab a ride?
What fields?
Ok sounds good
Centennial 
Couldn't make it today. 
Anyone going out there again tmrw after class?
I'm meeting with my group till 4, but I'm up for it after 
I'm not sure if I can tomorrow.
When is the first game, next week?
Next Thursday I believe
I'm down for tomorrow 
I should be able to make it
I'm down
<@U1KRMNVGC>: that works since we (blue cohort) don't get out until 4pm
How many people are down for today at 4? 
I got my gear
<@U1KRNHQA1>: get this error when I try to use channel 
I'll for sure be there as well
<@U1NDG6ULB> do you know how to change the setting? I can't figure it out
Not sure I'm pretty new to slack as well 
I may be there.
Centennial fields again?
"Ok, I guess"
I'll be there too
<@U1KRB11QC> yep same spot..hopefully we'll be good on parking again
How long will y'all be there? I'm almost on my way. 
Since we’re not playing in a competitive, shirt-bearing league would anyone want to order team shirts like past IM teams at the institute have done?
What time is the game Thursday?
6:30
Anyone can come, as long as you bring your student id. Emily's fiance Robin is going to play with us too.
Carb up tonight boys
I'm most likely not gonna be able to make tomorrow unfortunately 
Also don't forget to wear  shorts without pockets tomorrow
Thanks!
Without? Is that a rule? Cause I don't own any 
Yeah, I'm not sure if they'll actually check but they might.  I only have 1 pair but maybe someone has extra?
I have some extra ones
Honestly had no idea shorts without pockets were still a thing 
Hah exactly. But ok thanks Johnny. I'll test mine out and if I get caught I'll use yours as a backup. 
I didn't know they even existed lol
Yeah I'll bring extra in case anyone needs them. They may be a bit short for since people cause they are old and from my wrestling days lol
Shorter the better. More range of motion = more explosion off the line 
When will the next practice be anyway?
Yes, please bring extra shorts haha
When is everyone getting there today? I'm thinking 6 at the latest to warm up my legs/arm
This is a cleat activity right?
Cleats are not mandatory in the rules. I think it's your own preference 
OK cool, I don't have any right now 
Same
Also any specific shirt color?
Anybody here yet?
Almost there
Where'd you guys park 
In the deck
Almost there too
I'll bring jerseys
Colby and I are here... First set of bleachers closest to morril drive
What field are we on?
Good luck
<@U1KRB11QC>: I'm sorry they didn't let you play. That's so dumb 
Dumb rules. Sorry I just walked away. Should have stayed to support you guys. I'll find some pocket-less shorts this weekend and catch the next game. 
<@U1KRB11QC> what happened? 
How'd the game go?
I had a zipper pocket that was zipped and the ref called my number, asked if it was a pocket, and told me to go off the field. 
Oh dang I didn't see that. Sorry man
It went well except the other team wasn't good and there was a flag on every other play haha
That's good... And simultaneously bad. Looking forward to the next practice/game
It's Siemian time :football::football::football:
Luuuuuukeeeeeeeee
<@U1KSR1MS4>: Sammy Watkins?
<@U1L95JP1S>: Sammy wishes lol
<@U1KSR1MS4>: :thinking_face::thinking_face::thinking_face:
KB makes Watkins look like a smurf 
Sammy dont need size when he blows by everyone 
not fooling me rocky, thats whoopi goldberg
which is still pretty cool man, cant believe you bumped into her
Is there a game this week?
Yeah tomorrow 6:30
Sorry boys can't make it this week. Get that w 
A few people have already said they can't make it tomorrow so can everyone that is coming react to this somehow?
I can't make it tomorrow either my knee is messed up... Kick some ass for me team! 
I'll do my best to get there. I've got a meeting till 6:30... so well see.
Same for me... Might be a bit late if I make it at all
debating. pretty behind on classes
I think we have 7 coming now so its up to you
at what fields do we play?
<@U1PF7HWTF>: we need you there. 
Do you not have enough now
I can come let me know
Btw I told Peter I'd be there
Let us know what fields we are on
Looks like Field 3. I’ll probably be there around 6ish
Here
At the check in table
I'll be there in 10
I'm gonna get the jerseys we need to check in
Unless someone wants to pick them up real quick from the equipment rental desk :grinning: 
Nice 
Just got this, you're probably better off getting them at this point
Yeah no worries 
Where is field3
<!channel>: I got the jerseys 
Be there in a few
Outcome?
Undefeated 
Were they bad again?
They were way worse than last time
Terrible. Almost like they weren't even there.
They definitely didn't bring their A game! 
Yeah scrubs. And they were all kind of dicks too.
I feel like they didn't even wanna be there
Lots of flag guarding 
Who's going to the game tomorrow? I can't cause I have my kickoff meeting. 
I should be there
I can be there, but I'll need to borrow some shorts 
Im the shorts guys so your covered
I'll try to make it out there as well
I should be there. They will probably end up cancelling it due to the weather. Its 100% chance of rain the rest of the week
I should be there. What time's game? 
6:30
i'll be there if needed
I should be there as well
I'll be there if we play
Alright good luck and somebody remember to pick up the jerseys!
I think I might have to skip. I hurt my leg this morning.
Game is cancelled due to field conditions
#sadness
We have a game tomorrow! This time maybe we'll actually have a game
Anyone planning on going?
I am probably a no go unfortunately
I'm not gonna make it <@U1KRNHQA1> 
im probably out as well
Yeah I got some serious understanding to do around logistic
Aight probably gonna cancel the game
They may also cancel it due to weather because it's supposed to rain all night/day anyways 
Well they canceled it for today... So at least we don't have to worry about forfeiting due to lack of bodies
