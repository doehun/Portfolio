I've emailed a couple of places.  I'll keep you posted.  Looks like about $25 a person.  Trying to find something for Friday afternoon since we get out early.  
Awesome.  Thanks for setting this up John.  I've got the cable guy coming 1-3PM, but would for sure be in any time after then on Friday.
this is my only reference for escape rooms... <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3LMtRG4Mc54>
I'm trying to get us a 2pm time in Durham on Friday.   It would be $25 per person.  Can I get a head count of who could and would do that time if it happens?   If it doesn't, I'll book a time next week. 
I want to do it! 
I'm in!
i'm in as well - thanks for setting this up, John!
I can't this Friday (I'll be in Wilmington), but I'd be down for next week!
I'm down! 
I'd go 2pm Friday!
I'll go!
I'm definitely in 
I can't do 2pm on Friday, but I won't be able to do until 5pm-ish, so I guess I'll catch the next outing!
I'm in too! Thanks John!
I'm in!
Iâ€™m in too
hey id like to go too!
Escape rooms are full.  Maybe too many.  More details to be posted soon.
I won't be able to do Escape Room on Friday, but would love to go another time (after this weekend). Sounds like we'll have enough interest to do that!
Posted something in the forums.  More info soon
Dang I'll miss this Friday but let's do it again another time !! <@U1L6YQUSU> 
See new MSA forum post for instructions on how to pay, where we're going, etc.
