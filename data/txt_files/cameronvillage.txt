There is a car going to Sammy's Trivia tonight scooping up people around Cameron Village! I think we have one or two more spots!
anyone want to carpool around 5-5:10 to the dinner?
Hey Annabel! So sorry I just saw this. Next time though!
Anyone want to drive to sas together on Tuesday? <!channel> 
Yea I'd be down to carpool.
Id love to carpool as well
Same here 
great! I can drive us! just let me know if you all want to send me your addresses or meet somewhere in cameron village
Thanks! I live at oberlin court with <@U1L914KNJ> - what time were you thinking about picking us up?
I actually probably need to drive myself because I am going to be coming from school and I need to go somewhere in Cary briefly after!
next time though!
Okay! So just me <@U1M7AD5L2> and <@U1KRMNVGC> ? I can pick you up at noon Kelly? Do you think that is enough time with the traffic Michelle Obama might be causing being in town? I also don't know where SAS is haha
Yup where can I meet y'all? At Kelly's?
Its about ten minutes away from us without traffic so picking me up at noon will work - I'd much rather be 15-20 mins early rather than 1 min late
that can work conner - we have parking available for anyone out front!
I can pick you up wherever <@U1KRMNVGC>!
I live off Hillsborough which is traffic hell, so I'll meet yall at Kelly's at noon.  
Sounds great! See everyone then. I am a silver jeep commander
