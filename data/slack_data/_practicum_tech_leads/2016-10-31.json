If you're consistently reading in the entire dataset, then the database won't help much, but it won't hurt performance either.  It's a good learning experience either way, but a team has to manage how steep the total learning curve is for everyone.  for your specific practicum, I would imagine a database would be worthwhile to utilize for speeding up queries, but not essential.  If you're using SAS, it would be just as well to use SAS7BDAT formatted data with SAS indexes where appropriate in order to get faster query times.",
