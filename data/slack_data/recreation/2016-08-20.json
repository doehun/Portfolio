My goal is to create a running group that would be inclusive for everyone, and get the IAA together! This Tuesday morning at 6:30 A.M. will be the first group run starting at the institute. I have mapped out a four mile loop for everyone to follow that is attached below. If you are worried this distance is too far (or not far enough) for you currently , don't worry, the route can easily be altered to fit your current level of fitness. I will be staying with the person at the end to make sure no one gets lost. I hope to see some people Tuesday morning!  <http:\/\/www.mapmyrun.com\/routes\/view\/1227196714>",
