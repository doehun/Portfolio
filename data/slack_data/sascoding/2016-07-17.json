The way I try to think of it is that we are trying to predict the true population mean with our samples, but the true population mean never changes. If we take 100 samples, then 95% of those intervals should capture the true population mean. For those 95%, answer choice A could kind of make sense, but it is still not a \"chance\".... For the 5% where we will be wrong answer choice A would def not be correct... When our confidence interval does not actually capture the true population mean, then the population mean is not represented in that interval. Also we will never know the true population mean so we don't know if it is truly represented in our confidence interval. We also don't know the chances of it happening, we are just \"confident\" in our interval... Hope that makes sense :slightly_smiling_face:",

Yes, it does mean that the residuals have mean 0, but that will usually always be the case when linear regression is run. I think in this problem, Dr. Labarr is talking also about the linearity in the residual plot so can this be captured with a linear model. If it is not, you could have the problem of a misspecified model, so you might have to add higher order terms. For example, if the residual plots appear to have a quadratic shape, then you would want to square one or more of your predictor variables in order to capture the true relationship between your x variables and y.
