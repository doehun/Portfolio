Basically the idea of Junto is mutual improvement. We can figure out the specifics at our first meeting (if there are people interested in meeting), but essentially we would get together for 30 minutes to an hour to discuss books we're reading, current events, articles we've seen, movies, television shows...whatever you want. As long as you're making an attempt to be insightful. The questions on the Wiki page ( <https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/Junto_(club)> ) are a good guideline. Please let me know if you are interested through this channel, and we can start planning our first meeting!",
