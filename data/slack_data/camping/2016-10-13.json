Both hikes will meet at the summit of Mt. Mitchell together for group pictures and fun. If you decide not to hike (<@U1LMHQY9E>) try to meet us at the summit where there is a parking area around 3 PM.\n\nFood: David and I will provide burgers\/hotdogs and a few sides for dinner. You will want to bring food for the hikes, afternoon snacking, and breakfast. You should also plan to BYOB if you want.\n\nCamping: We will be outside. In the mountains. PLEASE bring warm clothes and jackets! It is better to have too many layers than not enough. Don\u2019t forget about gloves, hats, and scarves. You may also want to bring an extra blanket for warmth at night. David and I are actively trying to ensure everyone has sleeping bags, but you may have to rent them at Recreation Outdoors on Main Campus for $8 for the weekend. We will let you know by noon tomorrow.\n\nPayment: Remember to pay $15 via Venmo to ImDavidJordan by Friday at noon. You can also pay David via cash.",
