Here is the process for windows (from <http:\/\/stackoverflow.com\/questions\/13656699\/update-r-using-rstudio>): \n1. go to <http:\/\/www.r-project.org>,\n2. click on 'CRAN',\n3. then choose the CRAN site that you like. (there is one at Duke, nice and close)\n4. click on 'Download R for Windows', then click on \"Base\", then download the R 3.3.1 package.\n5. follow the installation procedure for your operating system\n6. restart RStudio - if you type \"version\" in the console, it should now show 3.3.1.\n7. rejoice",
