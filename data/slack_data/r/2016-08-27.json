When I use the lubridate package to convert this to a 'date' type it keeps most of the information I need.   Both of these types play nice with  geom_histogram() in ggplot but neither of them work with geom_vline() which seems to only want to take a number.  I'm totally stumped and I really need to overlay this line for my analysis, any ideas?",
