The team wouldn't be spending much time on the well if they realize it is a dry well, so should we assume it is 0?\n\n2. What did you mean by \"results\" when it says \"Use your results from the previous RFP to simulate drilling costs\"....should we sample from our 10,000 simulated values from HW1 or should we sample from our kernel distribution itself?\n\n3. Are we simulating values for a single dry well &amp; NPV of a single wet well starting in 2017 and (if it is a wet well) going for 15 years in the future?",

I think LaBarr's answer to our 2nd question is that we should simulate values for 2016 using whichever distribution we found to be \"correct\" from hw1....but reminder: for HW1 we simulated 2017 drilling costs, not 2016 (which is Year 0)...so it should be one less iteration for HW2 I think",
