You actually don't know which method is the correct solution to seasonality, so you basically try both differencing (stochastic) and dummy variables (deterministic), use both to build two models, then do whatever you need to do to remove trend, if you have any. Eventually, use the validation data to see which model is the better model, or you can also see which method to remove season is correct. ",
