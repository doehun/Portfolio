        "text": "Hey quick question about differencing for trend:\n\nIf your initial test has a high p-value, that indicates to take the first order difference.  If you take that first order difference and you then have low p-values, does that then indicate we need to perform regression on the trend?  Is it that differencing handled the trend?  Is it that we need to build a regression model on the differenced trend?  If there are horse shoes, are there any horse socks?  Is anybody listening to me?",
