I live within walking distance of Carter Finley stadium (around a 10 min walk), and there's ample parking at my apt building, so we can park there and walk over. If you plan on coming, respond to this post in some way so I can have an idea of how much food to get.\n\nWhen: After class on Thursday - around 4:30 or 5:00 PM! We will walk over to the stadium around 6:30 PM!\nWhere: 5401 Creek Ridge Lane, Raleigh NC 27607\nWho: Anyone! My apartment isn't huge but it's on the ground floor and opens to a little grassy area so I think there will be enough room\nWhat To Bring: BYOB, I'll have some food, but feel free to bring more.",
