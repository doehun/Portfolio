However, if you plan to attend, please register so that we can send you any additional information you may need as we get closer to the date.All ages are welcome. Very young children may not get much out of looking through a telescope, but those elementary-school-aged and older may especially enjoy the experience. Parents: We recommend\u00a0you\u00a0look through the telescope first\u2014then you\u2019ll be better able to help your child look.Sometimes, children (as well as adults) want to grab hold of the telescope, potentially smudging the eyepiece or knocking the object out of view. Please teach children not to touch the telescope without the operator\u2019s permission. You can ask children to place their hands behind their back as they approach the scope. Explain they\u2019ll be using their eyes to look, not their <http:\/\/hands.Be|hands.Be> sure to dress in layers. \u00a0There are no shelters at the skywatching location and the wind can be chilly.Please leave all pets at home, even those on a leash. Darkness, lots of people, expensive telescopes and pets on leashes is a bad combination. \u00a0For more FAQ's, please visit:\u00a0<http:\/\/moreheadplanetarium.org\/programs\/teen-adult-programs\/skywatching\/skywatching-faqLocation> and ParkingThe skywatching session will be located at Dorothea Dix Park on the Big Field. \u00a0This is bordered by Blair Drive, Barbour Drive and Biggs Drive.Parking is available in gravel lots on Biggs Drive (please do not park on grass under the trees) and at the Adams Building Lot, located roughly at 101 Blair Drive.Please be courteous when driving in and try not to have your headlights light up the field more than necessary.Please bring a small flashlight to help you walk across the field, but you might find that avoiding all light and letting your eyes adjust to the darkness is more beneficial. \u00a0Even a little light can throw off your night vision.Please Note:\u00a0There are no bathrooms in the park and no drinkable water, so please plan to bring a water bottle and come prepared to only have portajohns available, which are a significant walk from the skywatching site. Walking in grass and up and down hills may be necessary.Liability WaiverCity of Raleigh - Parks, Recreation and Cultural Resources DepartmentRelease, Covenant Not To Sue, and Indemnity Agreement\u00a0I understand that participating in Discover Dorothea Dix Park \u2013 Program (hereinafter \u201cProgram\u201d) involves risk of injury.
