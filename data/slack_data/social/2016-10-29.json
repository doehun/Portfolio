This is a reminder about PARTY NUMBER TWO of HOWLAWEEKEND this *Saturday at my place from 9pm - Whenever*. Significant others, roommates and dogs are all welcome! We\u2019ll have a costume contest, pong games, snacks and candy, glow sticks, a spooky fog machine dance floor (with lots of monster mash remixes and halloween flavored trap jamz). There will be a keg for those who don\u2019t want to BYOB. Just throw a couple bucks my way for a cup.\n\nMy address is *5435 Silver Moon Lane*. It\u2019s an end unit with orange string lights on the banister. The townhome complex has some visitor parking right near our place (8 spots or so). But there\u2019s more about 100 yards down the street at the intersection of Silver Moon and Retro Rose. Any unmarked spot not directly in front of a house is visitor parking. That being said, I encourage people to carpool or uber! Call me if you have any issues: <tel:804-687-5574|804-687-5574>.\n\nCongrats on Fall 2! I can\u2019t wait to see you all at Sylvie\u2019s and then at my place! You can do it! (Rumor is that Sylvie has a stash of pedialyte if you really need help on the double header parties).",

There\u2019s about 10 spots at the intersection of retro rose and silver moon lane another group of spots at the intersection of retro rose and Crescentview.
