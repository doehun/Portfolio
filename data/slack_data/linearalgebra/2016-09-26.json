She just wants you to know that you will be doing replacement math or using PROC PLS, but with PROC PLS you have to principal components in order so you wouldn't be able to do principal components 1, 3,4, and &amp;6, you would have to have 1-6 principal components in the PROC PLS (if you want only those principal components then you'd have to do the replacement math for it). I think thats all we have to know - not necessarily how to do the replacement math.",
