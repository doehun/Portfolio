Promise to show you *ALMOST NO CODE*, but talk about the basics of why and how to structure data in your code. Would be helpful for anyone whose practicum needs to be in python, folks that are trying to be more technical (i.e. west coast crew) and anyone else who wants to get a little more proficient in python.
