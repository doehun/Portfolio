                "text": "RALEIGH, N.C. &mdash; North Carolina Gov. Pat McCrory, speaking at the North Carolina Council of State, said Monday&rsquo;s Colonial Pipeline explosion could have severe effects on fuel supplies compared to what occurred in September, WNCN reported.\nIn a press conference Tuesday afternoon, McCrory said the pipeline&rsquo;s two main lines were initially down, but line two has reopened. Line one, which remains closed, supplies 70 percent of North Carolina&rsquo;s fuel supply.\nColonial Pipeline said Tuesday line one will likely remain closed for the rest of the week.\nA fire broke out Monday afternoon along a section of the Colonial Pipeline in Alabama, killing one person and injuring five others, the pipeline operator said. Images from the scene showed a massive plume of flames and smoke towering over nearby trees.&nbsp;The subcontractors were attempting to flush out the lines. When they started to dig, that is when the explosion happened.\nIn early September, part of the pipeline was closed for nearly two weeks because of a huge gasoline leak. That caused gas prices to spike by 28 cents in Georgia and 17 cents in Tennessee, also affecting North and South Carolina.\nMcCrory said the state continues to communicate with Colonial Pipeline about the possible impact, which could be &ldquo;tremendous,&rdquo; he said.\nAs of Tuesday afternoon, there is no timeline and state officials will begin to prepare options in case of an emergency.",
