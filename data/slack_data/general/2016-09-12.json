Here is the link: <http:\/\/vissoft16.ysu.edu\/program.html#keynote> \nHe's also willing to talk about all the jobs he's had since finishing college if someone wants to wade in and ask a question about that.\nThe lecture will be optional - in Bodie (combined cohorts) - and you can dress business casual as usual.\nPS: Friday is still Deloitte - you need your suits. They are bringing 25  people, so everyone should have a chance to chat with someone!\nLunch will be included and it's a full lunch - not just snacky food.",
