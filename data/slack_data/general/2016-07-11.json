        "text": "Hey guys! I spent some time working for a dermatologist and because it\u2019s getting hotter and sunnier outside I figured I would go ahead and drop some skincare knowledge on you guys. Since most of the sun damage that sets you up for skin cancer later on in life happens before the age of 30, this is the time (for most of us) to be taking great care of our skin. The risk of getting a melanoma is 1\/50 and rising in America (not taking family history, race, etc into account).\nEveryone should be using a good sunblock when they are in the sun. Physical barriers such as lotions containing zinc oxide and titanium dioxide with and SPF of at least 30 is the most effective. I\u2019m not a huge fan of sunscreen sprays as the FDA has not tested what happens when you inhale this product. (Therefore, you should never use this on children\/babies who do not yet understand the concept of holding their breath.)\nEveryone should be checking their skin once a month. This allows you to get really familiar with what your skin looks like. The ABCD\u2019s of melanoma are great to know but in general everything on you should look like everything on you\u2026 If you have something which looks like an outlier and you cannot find anything else like it on your body, then you should probably consult a dermatologist.\nThere are two known causes of an increased risk of melanoma: genetics (family history) and blistering sunburns before the age of 30. Tanning beds are also correlated with an increased risk. If you have a reddish hue to your hair or blue eyes this is a sign your body is not that great at making pigment and therefore your risk of sun burning is increased.  If your skin is naturally blessed with the ability to make pigment, then the most common place for a melanoma to occur is on the soles of the feet or palms of the hands. If your skin isn\u2019t naturally great, then any crack or crevice is fair game.\nAnd on a side note, the risk of breast cancer in women is 1\/8, which statistically speaking is quite a few of us. Therefore, we should be taking the proper preventative measures for this as well.\nCheers!",
