My church, the Church of Jesus Christ of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints, has been taking calls from anyone affected and organizing \"rescue\" clean up efforts for them. This week, a group of us and those of other faiths in this area who would like to help will be driving about an hour south to chop tree branches, knock out dry wall, and remove debris from people's homes. We will leave about 7am and be back at about 5pm. Let me know if you would be available to come....we have some volunteers but we need as many muscles as we can get!\n\nVideo of past efforts:\n<http:\/\/www.mormonnewsroom.org\/article\/mormon-helping-hands-flooded-homes-louisiana>\u00a0\u00a0\u00a0\n\nDescription of the organization:\n<http:\/\/www.mormonnewsroom.org\/article\/helping-hands>",
