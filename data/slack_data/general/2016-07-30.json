I have heard that quite a few of us would want to do that so I made a little website with some basic instructions how to get Python and will be posting some small projects - check it out: <https:\/\/sites.google.com\/a\/ncsu.edu\/learning-python-for-data-science\/>     \nThere is also a slack channel <#C1WNCHYSC> for those of you who would want to ask questions and discuss projects\/code... i don't know much Python, but would like to learn and maybe even assemble a team and try to tackle a project from <http:\/\/Kaggle.com|Kaggle.com> which would be very interesting... please feel free to share your feedback with me! have a great weekend everyone. :smile:",
