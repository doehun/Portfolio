You can sign up for the 5k competitive, 5k noncompetitive, or the 1 mile competitive or non competitive run\/walk. I will be running the 5k noncompetitive but you're welcome to sign up for whichever race or donate. Please join us and make a difference in the life of someone you care about with ASD!\n\nGo to this site: <http:\/\/support.autismsociety-nc.org\/site\/TR?fr_id=1140&amp;pg=entry> and click on Join a Team to join our team: Double the Ketchup\n\nYou can also search our team on that page and hit the donate button if you can't attend.
