Show starts at 8:00PM with an opener. We should all get together and pregame before the concert. Right now Sylvie and I have both volunteered our apartments so that's either Wolf Ridge on campus(me) or Sylvie's at 401 Oberlin Dr. If anyone else wants to volunteer their place if they're closer to downtown we're open to it, whatever is easiest for the group. We have a half day Friday so no excuses for not coming!!! It's gonna be an awesome show!!!",
